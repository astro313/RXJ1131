While the ISM in nearby galaxies has been studied in great detail, a wide knowledge gap persists between z=0 and the peak of cosmic SFR density (z~2). We here aim to bridge this gap by studying the ISM properties of a lensed AGN host galaxy at z~0.7. Previous observations show a high molecular gas mass in this system, distributed across a highly turbulent disk. By mapping CO(5-4),HCN(4-3),HCO+(4-3), and HCN-vibrational line emission on sub-kpc scales, we here aim to resolve the dynamical structure of the dense gas to investigate the interplay between AGN and starburst excitation of the gas. We will measure spatial variations in the HCN/HCO+ and HCN/CO line ratios to establish their utility as probes of buried AGNs out to high redshifts. We will also spatially resolve, for the first time, the "star-formation law" for dense gas tracers at high redshifts. This investigation will significantly improve our understanding of the relation between dense molecular gas kinematics and star formation activity at early cosmic epochs by utilizing diagnostics that were recently established in the nearby universe with ALMA - an essential precursor for future investigations at even higher redshifts.
