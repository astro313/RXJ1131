While the ISM in local ULIRGs (analogues of high-redshift starbursts) has been studied in great detail, a wide knowledge gap persists between z=0 and peak of cosmic star-formation density (z~2). We here aim to bridge this gap by studying the dynamical structure and properties of the ISM using the CO(J=5-4) line at 0.15" resolution (500pc) and the HCN(J=4-3) and HCO+(J=4-3) lines at 0.7" resolution (2.5 kpc) in a quadruply lensed gas-rich AGN host galaxy and its dust-obscured companion galaxy at z~0.7. The interacting system has been recently observed in low-J CO, showing large molecular gas content in both galaxies and signs of highly turbulent disk-like environment. Our proposed observations will spatially resolve the kinematics, dynamics and distribution of the warm, excited, dense molecular gas on sub-kpc scales to investigate the interplay between AGN and SB and their relation to the ISM in mergers. Spatial variations in the HCN/HCO+ and HCN/CO line ratios within the AGN host galaxy will allow us to assess their utilities as proxies to unveil deeply-buried AGNs, at higher redshift than current studies. In addition, these observations will spatially resolve, for the first time, the true Schmidt-Kennicutt relation for high gas density in a high-z merger, down to the size scale of star-forming gas clumps. Such detailed studies of the dense gas were overwhelming expensive prior to ALMA, yet vital to constrain models of star-formation and galaxy evolution. Our proposed observations therefore provide an exceptional opportunity to connect studies of dense gas properties in nearby galaxies to high-z systems, of which ALMA will routinely map in the near future.
