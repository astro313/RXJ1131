Abstract:
While the ISM in local ULIRGs (analogues of high-redshift starbursts) has been studied in great detail, a wide knowledge gap persists between z=0 and peak of cosmic star-formation density (z∼2). We propose to observe the CO(J=5→4) line at 0.15” resolution (∼500pc) and the HCN(J=4→3) and HCO+(J=4→3) lines at 0.7” resolution (2.5 kpc) in a gravitationally lensed gas-rich AGN host galaxy and its dust-obscured companion galaxy at z~0.7. We will resolve the kinematics, dynamics and distribution of the warm, excited, dense molecular gas on sub-kpc scale to determine the nature giving rise to the unusually high velocity dispersion and investigate the star-formation mode and the interplay between starburst and AGN in mergers in great detail. 
While HCN and HCO+ have been suggested to be faithful tracers of the dense star-forming gas, only five detections exist at z>0.3, it is therefore unclear whether the observed linearity in the star-formation law is valid at high redshifts, our proposed observations will address this as well as assess the fidelity of using HCN/HCO+,HCN/CO line ratios as a proxy to unveil deeply-buried AGNs, at higher redshift than current studies and examine the presence of a buried AGN in the companion. With the aid of lensing magnification, we will characterize the ISM of high-z mergers with finer detail than otherwise possible with current facilities.
