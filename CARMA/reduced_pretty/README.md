# Important files (.fits)

# NOTE:
- wanted to calibrate 2nd observations data and planned to place reduced file here
    + However, didn't and won't calibrate that set beacuse of terrible phase
- wanted to combine reduced data from both observations to form one dataset, but 2nd observations data is NOT acceptable
