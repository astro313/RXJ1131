Note: 
- check flux scale (consistent 3C279 @ 1.5mm with online database)
- phase calibrator is faint and poor weather (for set 2)
  + can try different solint...
- phase calibrator is far from source (for set3)
  + i.e. gain solutions aren't perfect for target, as they are derived for a different direction
