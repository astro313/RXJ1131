     The on-line baseline parameters for antenna(s) 9   have recently
     been updated (prior to your observing run) to correct for errors
     resulting from their recent relocations.  In the analysis of your data
     would you please check for any significant baseline errors
     especially on these antennas and let the Data Analysts (email -
     analysts@nrao.edu) know what you find when there are significant
     baseline errors.  Thank you in advance.
