Determine continuum source size, and flux density.
initial: 10Nov15/ 


This directory (only for inspection, not for further analysis): 
- since it appears there's a 3sigma blob East of the central continuum -->
- try different clean box to see if the 3*sigma blob East of the central continuum is real.
- see script: /Users/admin/Research/RXJ1131/PdBI/src/imaging_daisy/cont_im_checkBlob.map

Imaging:
- note the blob is there in dirty map as well
Note: noise slightly higher in this cleaned map than that in 10Nov15, which is closer to theoretical
- go noise              ! 9.1782378E-05
- poly --> mean         ! r.m.s.:  9.12896E-05

### Since the blob is probably real --> further analysis refers to 10Nov15/
