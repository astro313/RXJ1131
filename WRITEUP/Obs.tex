\section{Observations}
\subsection{PdBI} \label{sec:PdBIdata}
Observations of the CO($J$ = 2 $\rightarrow$ 1) rotational line ($\nu_{\rm rest}$ = 230.5379938 GHz) toward the background galaxy RXJ1131-1231 at $z$ = 0.655BLAH
 were carried out using IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI) at the redshifted frequency of $\nu_{\rm obs}$ = 
 BLAH GHz (BLAH mm) (Program ID: S14BX001; PI: D. Riechers). 
 Two observing runs were carried out on 2014 Dec 06 and 2015 Feb 05 under excellent / GOOD?

weather conditions in the C and D array configurations, respectively. The 2 mm receivers were used to cover the redshifted CO($J$ = 2 $\rightarrow$ 1) line and the underlying continuum emission (rest frame BLAH = (2.152 * (1+z)) mm), employing a correlator setup providing an effective bandwidth of 3.16 GHz and spectral resolution of 10.0 MHz ($\sim$21.5281 km s$^{-1}$).
This resulted in 2.2 hours and 1.5 hours of six antenna-equivalent on-source time

after discarding unusable visibility data for C and D array observations, respectively.
% D: 1.5 hours; 1055+018 , 3C279 (RF, fixed flux), 1127-145 (phase/amp), 1124-106(ditto)
% C: 2.2 hours; MWC349 (fixed flux), 1055+018 (RF = bandpass), 1124-186 (phase/amp), 1127-145 (ditto)
% total: 3.75 hours
%For both tracks, 
The nearby quasars 1127$-$145 and 1124$-$186 were observed every BLAH minutes for
pointing, secondary amplitude, and phase calibration, and MWC349 was observed as the primary
absolute flux calibrator for C array observations.
The nearby quasars 1127$-$145 and 1124$-$106 were observed every BLAH minutes for
pointing, secondary amplitude, and phase calibration, and 3C279 was observed as the primary
absolute flux calibrator for D array observations.
1055$+$018 and 3C279 were observed as bandpass calibrators for C and D array observations, respectively, yielding $\lesssim
$15\% calibration accuracy.

The GILDAS package was used to reduce and analyze the visibility data which are then imaged and deconvolved using
the CLEAN algorithm with ``natural" weighting. This yields a synthesized clean beam size of 4$\farcs$44 $\times$ 1\farcs95. The final rms noise is $\sigma$ = 0.177 Jy km s$^{-1}$ beam$^{-1}$ over a channel width of 320 MHz (corresponding to 690 km s$^{-1}$), and $\sigma$ = 1.451 Jy km s$^{-1}$ beam$^{-1}$ over 10 MHz (21.5 km s$^{-1}$) . 
The continuum image is created by % 2.152 mm; 
averaging over all the line-free channels ($\nu_{\rm cont}\sim$139 GHz). This yields an rms noise of 0.082 mJy beam$^{-1}$. % see README.md in 04Sep15

\subsection{CARMA} \label{sec:carmadata}
Observations of the CO($J$ = 3 $\rightarrow$ 2) rotational line ($\nu_{\rm rest}$ = 345.7959899 GHz) toward the background galaxy RXJ1131-1231 at $z$ = 
0.655BLAH 
 were carried out using the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA) at the redshifted frequency of $\nu_{\rm obs}$ = BLAH GHz (BLAH mm) (Program ID: BLAH; PI: D. Riechers).
Two observing runs were carried out on 2013 April 27 and Jun 09 under excellent 3 mm weather conditions in the C and D array configurations, respectively. The 3 mm receivers were used to cover the redshifted CO($J$ = 3 $\rightarrow$ 2) line, employing a correlator setup providing a bandwidth of 3.75 GHz in each sideband and spectral resolution of 5.208 MHz ($\sim$17 km s$^{-1}$). The line was placed in the
upper sidebands for both tracks with the local oscillator tuned to $\nu_{\rm LO}\sim$ 90.7 GHz; this resulted in 1.9 hours and 2.6 hours of 15 antenna-equivalent on-source time after discarding unusable visibility data for C and D array observations, respectively.

For both tracks, the nearby radio quasar J1310+323 was observed every 15 minutes for
pointing, amplitude, and phase calibration, and MWC349 was observed as the primary
absolute flux calibrator. J1337$-$129 and 3C273 were observed as bandpass calibrators for C and D array observations, respectively, yielding $\sim
$15\% calibration accuracy.
The MIRIAD package was used to calibrate and analyze the visibility data which are imaged and deconvolved using
the CLEAN algorithm with ``natural" weighting. This yields a synthesized clean beam size of 2$\farcs$6 $\times$ 2\farcs2 for the upper sideband image cube. The final rms noise is $\sigma$ = 0.68 Jy km s$^{-1}$ beam$^{-1}$ over a channel width of 208.3 MHz (corresponding to 687 km s$^{-1}$). % one bin is 83.195 km s$^{-1}$
The continuum image is created by
averaging over all the line-free channels ($\nu_{\rm cont}\sim$90.7 GHz). This yields a synthesized clean beam size of 3\farcs5 $\times$ 3\farcs0 and an rms noise of 0.24 mJy beam$^{-1}$.

\subsection{VLA} 
Observations of the BLAH continuum ($\nu_{\rm rest}$ = BLAH GHz) toward the galaxy RXJ1131-1231 were carried out using the {\it Karl G. Jansky} Very Large Array (VLA) at the redshifted frequency of $\nu_{\rm obs}$ = BLAH GHz (BLAH mm) (Program ID: BLAH; PI: BLAH).
Observations were carried out on BLAH under excellent/GOOD? BLAH mm weather conditions in the A array configurations. The C-Band receivers were used to cover the BLAH
, employing a correlator setup providing a bandwidth of BLAH GHz in each sideband. This resulted in BLAH hours of BLAH antenna-equivalent on-source time after discarding unusable visibility data.

The nearby radio quasar BLAH was observed every BLAH minutes for
pointing, amplitude, and phase calibration, and BLAH was observed as the primary
absolute flux calibrator. BLAH were observed as bandpass calibrators, yielding $\sim
$15\% calibration accuracy.
The AIPS package was used to calibrate and analyze the visibility data which are imaged and deconvolved using
the CLEAN algorithm with ``natural" weighting. This yields a synthesized clean beam size of 2$\farcs$6 $\times$ 2\farcs2 for the continuum image. The final rms noise is $\sigma$ = 0.68 Jy km s$^{-1}$ beam$^{-1}$.

%We detect unresolved CO($J$ = 3 $\rightarrow$ 2) line emission toward the background SMG SMM J0939+8315. We extract the spectrum and fit a single-component Gaussian as shown in Figure \ref{fig:mom0}, yielding peak flux density of 10.3 $\pm$ 1.7 mJy, the FWHM of the Gaussian fit is 541.65 $\pm$ 31.91 km s$^{-1}$. The spatial extent of the SMG is shown in the SMA 1 mm dust continuum in Figure \ref{fig:mom0}, where the synthesized beam size of the SMA observation is 1\farcs42$\times$1\farcs16, at P.A. -34.0\degr. Since the angular resolution of our CO measurement is 13$\farcs$57 $\pm$ 1\farcs4 $\times$ 5\farcs77 $\pm$ 3\farcs1, the CO($J$ = 3 $\rightarrow$ 2) detection in the SMG is therefore spatially unresolved. We construct the velocity-integrated (moment-0) map of the CO($J$ = 3 $\rightarrow$ 2) emission using the uv-continuum subtracted data, the velocity-integrated CO($J$ = 3 $\rightarrow$ 2) line flux is 14.6 $\pm$ 0.9 Jy km s$^{-1}$.

From this image, it is apparent that the extent of the background SMG is smaller than the beam size of the CARMA data, hence the CO($J$ = 3 $\rightarrow$ 2) detection is spatially unresolved.
