\section{Gravitational Lens model}

\subsection{interpretation}
- C06 suggest the presence of an interacting dusty galaxy in their HST
observations, which BJB+08 calls it the F component. The lensed images of the
ABCDE 
components coincide with our CO data (see mom0 on HST and channel map),
evidently CO emission coming from the AGN host galaxy. 
- one of the red channels in our lens model suggests a second source component,
which is consistent with the spatially offset dusty source (see mom0 on HST,
which 
the red velocity component coincides with this F component)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
+ Compare our lens model parameters on the mass distribution of the lensing
galaxy with literature (specifically SIE model in C06)
	- C06: SIE model shows position of lensing mass is offset by (-0.015",
-0.041" from obs. (i.e. light centroid)); PA = -73.6, ellipticity = 0.45,
theta\_R = 1.84" $\pm$ 0.01 
	- Our model lens parameters (median):
		- file: WRITEUP/MedianLensModelParams.txt
		- lensing gal. position is consistent with C06, 
		- Einstein radius: consistent with C06
		- PA: consistent within errors
		- Axial ratio: consistent within errors
