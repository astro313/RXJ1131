REFEREE'S REPORT ON THE PAPER BY LEUNG, RIECHERS, AND PAVESI


This is an interesting and well-written paper with new results.
It gives a very useful summary of all the data, 
covering optical, near-IR, mid-IR, far-IR, 
mm-line and continuum, and cm-radio.

I have some suggestions for improvement. 
The list is long, but most items can be quickly fixed.

My main suggestions are:

1. Suppress some of the use of the word "dynamics". 
Consider changing the title of the paper.

2. Fix the redshift. It should be 0.6541, not 0.6537. 

3. Fix the errors on the CO(2-1) flux and on the source size.

4. Fix the S/N discussion of the CO(3-2) line.

5. Fix the errors on the 2mm continuum flux.


6. Drop the spectral index for the background galaxy (errors too big).

7. Make better labels for Figure 6. 
Re-arrange Table 3 to agree with Fig.6.

8. Add a Table to summarize the CO observed quantities.
Add another Table to give the derived quantities.

9. Fix the error bars in Table 1.

10. Fix the Caption for the VLA map (Fig.4).


11. The BLR lines are redshifted relative to systemic, not blueshifted.
(Must fix this in at least three places).

12. Suggestions for shortening the paper: 

a) ---Drop the "black hole recoil" story (Section 5.3).

b) ---Drop the detailed description of the best-fit procedures
(The Markov chain Monte Carlo paragraph in Sect.4.1, paragraph 3). 

c) ---Drop the details of the SED fitting procedure in Sect.4.5, 
(especially in the 2nd half of paragraph 1: 
"We impose a uniform prior"...and all the text that follows.) 


13. Fix the Conclusions.


14. Change Figure 9 (left panel). Drop the moment map (same as in Fig.2).

COMMENTS IN DETAIL:

1) TOO MANY "DYNAMICS" AND "DYNAMICAL". 

You may be mis-using the word "dynamical" in some places.
"Dynamics" refers to the effects of a force, or forces, in 
causing motions, or in reaching equilibrium.

So if you are mainly talking about velocities, it would be 
better to say "velocities" or "kinematics" instead of "dynamics".


1a): CHANGE THE TITLE : DROP THE WORD "DYNAMICS" :

The Title says the paper is about the "dynamics" of the molecular gas in the 
quasar host galaxy. 

Most of the paper, however, is not about the "dynamics" at all, 
but rather about the CO detections,
the VLA continuum map (synchrotron emission, not molecular gas), 
the spectral energy distribution in the optical, near-IR, mid-IR, and far-IR continuum,
and the gravitational lens model.

I suggest that you consider changing the title, to better describe the
contents of the paper, maybe something like:

"CO-Line, Radio Continuum, Optical-to-Far-IR Observations, and Lens Models of
the Host Galaxy of the Quasar RXS J1131-1231"

or maybe:

"Interpretation of CO, Radio, Optical, and IR Continuum 
observations of the Strongly Lensed Host Galaxy of the 
Quasar RXS J1131-1231"

or simply:

"CO, Radio, Optical, and IR results on 
the Lensed Host Galaxy of the Quasar RXS J1131-1231".



1b) DROP "DYNAMICALLY RESOLVED":

Sect.3.1, paragraph 1:

"The emission is spatially and dynamically resolved...as shown in Fig. 1 "

"Dynamically resolved" sounds strange. 
The reader might confuse it with the dynamic range.
Maybe change to : 

"The line emission is resolved, in both velocity (Fig. 1) and 
in its spatial distribution (Fig. 2).



1c) DROP "DYNAMICAL CENTER":

Fig.3, caption:
"...z = 0.6537, which corresponds to the dynamical center of CO(2-1)."

Change to :

"..which corresponds to zero velocity in the CO(2-1) spectum (Fig.1)."





1d): DROP "RECONSTRUCT THE DYNAMICS" :

Sect.4.1, para.1:

Too many "dynamics" in this paragraph.

"...the high spectral resolution .. provides dynamical information 
on scales smaller than the beam ..."

Maybe change to "velocity information" or "kinematic information".


"...we reconstruct the intrinsic gas dynamics by carrying out 
lens modeling over different channel slices..."


You are not reconstructing the "dynamics", 
you are reconstructing the intrinsic spectral profile, by separately 
deriving the lens magnifications in seven different velocity channels.

As you say in the Abstract, this shows that the asymmetric line profile
(red peak stronger than blue peak) is actually symmetric.

I don't think this is reconstructing the "dynamics."
The "dynamics" stays the same --- rotation in a gravitational force field.

You have just reconstructed the line shape, that's all.


Contrary to what you say in Sect.4.1, this is actually not 
"similar" to the "differential lensing ...across the HST V, I and H bands (Claeskens+ 2006)

They talk about different magnification due to varying sizes of different temperature regions.
In the Claeskens reconstruction, the blue light (redshifted to V band) comes from young hot stars 
in a nuclear starburst ring --- see their sect.5.2, point 4. 

The V-band source is smaller (more compact) than the cooler regions in I and H bands,
in the larger spiral disk farther from the nucleus.

So, they interpret the different magnifications as due to different sizes in the source plane.

This is not the same as magnification varying across the line profile,
due to different source-plane positions, as you are claiming.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) FIX THE REDSHIFT. IT SHOULD BE 0.6541 .

Your beautiful CO(2-1) spectrum gives the best measurement 
so far of the qso host galaxy redshift,
more precise than the optical spectra. 

For this reason, you should make a little extra effort to get it exactly right.


2a. OBSERVED FREQUENCY, NOT LO FREQUENCY.

Sect.2.1, para. 1:

You say nu_LO = 139.256 GHz.
But this is your observed frequency, not the LO frequency.
It corresponds to CO(2-1) redshifted to 0.6555.

What probably happened was this:

a) You say that you first observed at CARMA (Feb.2014).
At CARMA, your sensitivity was only good enough to see the red peak, and not the blue one.
From the CARMA data, you derived the wrong redshift of z = 0.6555.


b) You say that you then observed at IRAM (later, in Dec.2014 and Feb.2015).
Because you already had the (incorrect) redshift from CARMA, 
you set the IRAM observing frequency to the wrong redshift of 0.6555 (139.256 GHz),

Then, with the better sensitivity at IRAM, you discovered that the true line profile 
was actually centered closer to z = 0.6537 (139.4074 GHz).


c) Later on, you re-reduced the data, this time with zero velocity corresponding 
to z = 0.6537, for all the figures in this paper.


d) But your Fig.1 (CO 2-1 spectrum), and especially, 
Fig.5 (both spectra, yellow and blue histograms),
show clearly that the line centroid is at +75 km/s relative to zero velocity.


e) At redshifted CO(2-1), there are 2.15 km/s per MHz, so the true line centroid 
is 34.88 MHz lower than your assumed zero frequency, and 
so the true line centroid is at 139.373 GHz.


f) This corresponds to z = 0.6541, as the true redshift of the host galaxy. 


g) SUGGESTED CHANGES : 

Sect.3.1, para.1: 
"...confirming the redshift at z = 0.6537..."

--- change to:
"...showing that the line centroid is at a redshift of z = 0.6541..."


Fig.3 caption:
"The velocity scale is with respect to z=0.6537, which corresponds to the dynamical center..."

--- change to:
"The zero of the velocity scale is at z=0.6537, which is close to the 
true centroid of the CO(2-1) line at z=0.6541 ...



Sect.4.5 para.2:

---Possibly re-do the fit, relative to a zero velocity at z = 0.6541, as this will change
the V_max in your p-v diagram (Fig.9, right panel).

--- Or else just explain that the V_0 in your Eq(1) comes out to +28 km/s (relative to z=0.6537)
because of the very coarse sampling of your seven 108 km/s-wide bins. 

The true line center (relative to z=0.6537) would be at V_0 = +75 km/s if you had
used the full-resolution spectrum (Fig. 1 or Fig.5), rather than the heavily binned channels.



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



3) CO(2-1) FLUX AND SOURCE SIZE : 

Sect. 3.1, para.1: CO(2-1) LINE FLUX :

You say the 2-Gaussian fit gives :
red peak = 75.3 mJy (do you mean mJy/beam?), FWHM=179 km/s,
and blue peak = 24 mJy (do you mean mJy/beam?), FWHM = 255 km/s.

This gives 1.06 x 75.3 x 179 /1000 = 14.3 Jy km/s for the red peak,
and gives 1.06 x 24.1 x 255 /1000 = 6.5 Jy km/s for the blue peak.

So the sum of the two peaks is 20.8 Jy km/s, not the value of 24.1 Jy km/s in the text.

Or, are the values you quote for two Gaussian components only the values at the top pixel of the map?
That is, not spatially integrated, while the 24.1 Jy km/s is spatially integrated?
You need to make this clear, both in the text, and in the caption to Fig.1.

If Fig.1 shows only the spectrum at the source maximum, and not the 
spatially integrated spectrum, then you need to change the label on the vertical axis 
to Flux density per beam [ mJy /beam ].

In the re-plot of the CO(2-1) spectrum that you give in Fig.5 (yellow histogram),
the redshifted peak is now 100 mJy, not 75, as in Fig.1. 

Does Fig.5 now show the spatially integrated spectrum ? 
What is the difference between this spectrum and the one in Fig.1? 

If it is again a spectrum taken at the maximum-intensity point,
then the units on the vertical axis would again have to be [ mJy/beam ]. 

In Fig.5,it would be good to show what you think is the contribution from the companion galaxy.




Sect. 3.1, para.3: SOURCE SIZE :

I don't think you can measure source size to three significant figures,
especially if you measure the beam-smoothed sizes in the image plane,
and then try to estimate the deconvolved sizes by doing root square
subtraction of the beam sizes (if that's what you did).

An advantage of an interferometer is that you can 
do fits to the source size in the u,v plane, without having
to deconvolve the beam.

Because the whole process is uncertain, 
instead of saying " 5.1 +/- 0.72 by 3.72 +/- 0.66 ",
you could just say 5.1 +/- 0.7 by 3.7 +/- 0.7 .

This is especially true because you say in the next sentence, that the 
emission is not a 2-D Gaussian, so the fitted model is anyway 
not correct.

But an even bigger problem is that these values look like the observed (not deconvolved)
major and minor axis sizes (FWHM) on the integrated map in Fig.2 (upper left).

Are you sure that you have deconvolved these sizes? For a 4.4" x 2" beam?

Please check this.

Even better, try doing a fit in the u,v plane, rather than the sky plane.


Here's another problem with the source size:
In Sect.1, para.3, you say the stellar emission in the host galaxy of RXJ1131 is 
lensed into an Einstein ring of radius 1.83" (diameter = 3.66"). 
So the length of the arc is about 4 or 5 arcsec.

In Table 3, you say the median magnification is a factor of 5.5.

This means the de-magnified CO source DIAMETER is about 1 arcsec.

At z = 0.654, 1 arcsec is 7 kpc. 

So the de-magnified RADIUS of the CO source is only 3.5 kpc.

It looks like the intrinsic R_CO = 6 kpc (diameter = 12 kpc)
that you quote elsewhere in the paper is too high:
---Abstract, 
---Sect.4.3, para.3, 
---Sect.4.4, para.1, 
---Sect.5.1.1, para.2,
---Sect.5.5, para.2
---Sect.5.1.1, para.2,
---Sect.6, para.2

--------------------------------------------------------------------



4) ERRORS ON CO(3-2):

Sect. 3.2, para 1: 
"We detect CO(3-2) ... in the CARMA data at > 5 sigma significance."(Fig.3).

Something is wrong here. In Fig.3, the peak-to-peak noise 
in 36 km/s channels, is 100 mJy/beam. 
This means 1 sigma is 25 mJy/b. 

This disagrees with Sect.2.2, para.3, which says 1 sigma is 
only 13.3 mJy/b in 36 km/s (25 MHz).

So, while the positive-velocity peak in Fig.3 is 4 or 5-sigma,
the negative velocity peak is only 2 or 3-sigma, so not really significant. 

Without knowledge of the CO(2-1) spectrum,
the negative-velocity peak at CO(3-2) could not be called a real detection.

Maybe change the first sentence of Sect.3.2 to read:

"We detect CO(3-2) ... in the CARMA data at 5-sigma significance
on the positive-velocity peak. 
Within the noise limits, the CO(3-2) spectrum (Fig.3) may be
consistent with the double-peak profile seen in CO(2-1) (Fig.1)."

Because of the large errors in the CO(3-2) flux, you should not
quote the flux and the errors to three significant figures (Sect. 3.2).

Instead of saying "35.7 +/- 21.9, 
you could just say 36 +/- 22 .

Similarly, in the same paragraph, for the (3-2) / (2-1) ratio,
you could just say 0.7 +/- 0.4 .


In Sect.3.2, para.1, you say the observing frequency is 209 GHz.
So the wavelength is 1.4mm, not 1.5mm. 
(There are two places to fix this).


---------------------------------------------------------------------


5) ERRORS ON THE 2MM CONTINUUM FLUX OF RXJ 1131:
Sect. 3.3, para.1:
The wavelengths should be 1.4mm for the CARMA data (not 1.5mm),
and 2.2mm for the IRAM data.



Sect.3.3, para.2: 
"We adopt 0.39 +/- 0.08 mJy as the 2mm continuum ...."

But Table 1 lists "0.400 +/- 0.082 " as the flux.

Both of these entries are wrong.

In Sect.3.3, para.2, you say :

integrated flux = 1.2 +/- 0.2 mJy, 
peak flux = 0.8 +/- 0.09 mJy/b at the lensing galaxy. (round off the 0.799 +/- 0.088).

You subtract a model point source at the lensing galaxy.

This gives a residual of (1.2 - 0.8) = 0.4 mJy.

But since this is a subtraction, you have to add the errors 
in the integrated flux (0.2 mJy)
to the errors in the possible point source (0.09 mJy) to get
the total uncertainty range in the residual.

So the flux of the residual is 0.4 +/- 0.3 mJy, 
not the +/- 0.08 mJy, 
which is only the raw rms in the unsubtracted data.

This means the 2mm continuum "detection" of the lensed arc (Fig.4 upper)
may not be real. 
On the map in Fig.4, it is only a bend in the lowest contour (3-sigma), 
so not really significant.

It might be better to rewrite Sect.3.3, para.2 to say something like:

"We detect 2mm continuum with an integrated flux density of 1.2+/-0.2 mJy,
with a peak flux of 0.80+/-0.09 mJy/beam, centered on the lensing galaxy.
In the lowest contour (3-sigma), there is a hint of possible emission
from the lensed arc."


Instead of calling this the "deblending procedure",
which people might confuse with deconvolution, 
I would just call it "subtraction of the foreground galaxy", 
or "flux removal by subtraction", because it is just simple 
subtraction, not anything else.


----------------------------------------------------------------


6) DROP THE SPECTRAL INDEX FOR THE BACKGROUND GALAXY :

Sect.3.3, para.3:

Given the large uncertainty in the residual flux, I don't think
you can derive a 6cm-to-2mm spectral index for the background galaxy.
I suggest dropping that part of the sentence:
(" alpha = -0.345 for the background galaxy ")


If the 2mm continuum flux is synchrotron emission, like the 6cm VLA continuum flux,
then it is probably unrelated to the stellar mass of the quasar host galaxy.

So I don't understand why you use it in sect.4.5, para.4 to fit 
the Bruzual & Charlot stellar templates.


Any comment on the very flat spectrum for the lensing elliptical galaxy ?
Is the 6cm emission mainly synchrotron? 
Is the 2mm emission a mix of synchrotron flux and dust flux ?


----------------------------------------------------------------------------



7) BETTER LABELS FOR FIGURE 6 AND TABLE 3 :

Figure 6 and Table 3 are hard to understand, because
there are no velocity labels on Fig.6, and because the order 
of the channels in the Figure (most redshifted first, most blueshifted last),
is the opposite of the order in Table 3 
(most blueshifted first, most redshifted last).

The easiest way to fix this would be to :

a) Put some velocity labels on Fig. 6, at least the center velocity
of each of the seven channels.

b) Reverse the order of the channels in Table 3
(change to most redshifted first, most blueshifted last), to 
agree with the order in Fig.6.




-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


8) NEED A TABLE TO SUMMARIZE THE CO RESULTS

There are tables where one can find :

--- the continuum photometry data (Table 1),

--- the model lens parameters (Table 2; please add the mass of the lens to this Table,
even though it is not an independent parameter; otherwise people have to search
for it in the text),

--- the model magnification factors (Table 3; possibly add the derived source offset positions), 

--- the fits to the IR continuum SED (Table 4).


But there is no table that gives a quick summary of the 
CO results, --- even though they are a large part of the paper.

I suggest that you add a Table, that as a minimum, might give:

--- the CO(2-1) velocities, linewidths, peak fluxes, line-integrated fluxes,
and spatially integrated fluxes.

--- the CO(3-2) similar parameters (when possible).


--- the L'co luminosities corrected for lensing (RXJ1131 + companion).


--- the M(H2) estimated from the CO luminosity (main source + companion).



The same is true of the derived quantities. 
Possible add another Table summarizing the other derived quantites:


--- R_CO (max) ---From whatever is the best method to estimate it.

--- the M_stellar and SFR ---From the SED fitting.

--- the M_dyn If R = 6 kpc and V = 245 km/s (??)

--- the M_gas / M_dyn ratio

--- the M_gas / M_stars ratio

--- the black hole mass

--- the M_BH / M_bulge ratio.



Otherwise, the reader has to search for all these CO values and other quantities in 
many different parts of the text.


--------------------------------------------------------------------


9. TABLE 1, ERROR BARS :

In Sect.2.1, you say the calibration accuracy at 2mm is 15 per cent;
in Sect.2.3, you say the calibration accuracy at 6cm is 10 per cent.

So in Table 1, the 2mm continuum flux error should include the 
10% measuring error plus the 15% calibration error, which add
as sqrt(sum of squares of percent errors) = 18%.

So S(2mm) = 0.80 +/- 0.14 .


Similarly, the 6cm continuum flux error should be the 3% measuring 
error plus the 10% calibration error (root sum squares) = 10.4%.

So S(6cm) = 0.87 +/- 0.09 .


So you need not quote these fluxes to three decimal places.

Because of these flux errors, you also cannot quote the spectral
index of the foreground galaxy to three decimal places
(Sect. 3.3, last sentence).



-----------------------------------------------------------------------


10. FIGURE 4, CAPTION (VLA MAP) :

Because the lensing galaxy is so strong on the VLA map (Fig.4), one
cannot count the contours on the central source. 
So in the caption, 
it might be good to say how many contours there are up to the peak
(= 22 contours ?), and that this corresponds to a flux of 0.9 mJy/b.

An alternative would be to change the contour step after 3 contours
in the VLA map, so that the higher contours would become visible.

But it is probably easiest to just explain the peak value in 
the figure caption.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


11. THE BLR LINES ARE REDSHIFTED, NOT BLUESHIFTED.

Sect.5.3, para.1:
Note that Sluse et al. (2007, their sect.7.2) say the Mg absorption doublet is at 0.654.
Sluse et al (their sect.9, Conclusions) also say the narrow emission lines (the NLR)
are measured to be at 0.654.

So in Sect.5.3,par.1 you should quote them correctly as saying that the first set of lines
is at z = 0.654 (not 0.653).


The 1st set of lines (NLR) is at z = 0.654 (not 0.653).
The 2nd set of lines (BLR) is at z = 0.658 (they are more redshifted).


So this sentence is wrong:

"On the other hand, the second set of lines is blueshifted by 780 km/s,.."

This should read "redshifted", not "blueshifted." 

(The 780 km/s is also wrong, 
it should be 700 km/s, see below)


"Using the CO line center redshift as the systemic redshift,
we find that the redshift of the first set is fully consistent
with the "systematic" redshift.

--- Change "systematic" to "systemic".




Sect.5.3, para.3, 2nd sentence from end:

Also wrong, here.

Should be "... our CO observations confirm the redshifted BLR lines."

not "blueshifted".


----------------------------------------------------------------------------



12. DROP THE "BLACK HOLE RECOIL" SECTION.

You might consider dropping this section entirely.

---The two redshift systems (NLR and BLR) in this quasar have
been known for a long time. 
So the possibility that the NLR-BLR difference is due to a black hole recoil is not 
a new result of your CO-line data, or of your lens modeling, 
which is the main topic of this paper.


---There are many quasars where the BLR redshifts are measured 
to be slightly different from the NLR redshifts.
Sometimes they are more redshifted, sometimes they are more blueshifted.
It is implausible that they all indicate black hole recoils.


---There is a large literature on the redshift differences between
the NLR and BLR lines 
(see e.g., Gaskell, 2009, New Astronomy Reviews, 53, 140; 
Gaskell & Goosmann 2015; Gaskell, Klimek & Nazarova 2007). 
There has been a lot of numerical modeling to explain these differences.

Many simulations favor an inflow of the BLR gas
into the black hole, at a true space velocity of 1000 km/s.

In the BLR, we are actually observing the matter that is flowing into
the black hole. The dominant component in the BLR linewidths is the
rotation of the accretion disk, but there is also an inflow component,
that causes the redshift difference from the NLR lines.

In the simulations, whether the difference is is a blueshift or a redshift
depends on the orientation to the line of sight and the "moving mirror" effect of
the scattering opacity, as well as the clumpiness, etc. 

A redshift could result from the disk being more edge-on to our line-of-sight, so 
that clumps in the disk itself block the far side. In this case, we mainly see
the near side, so we see the redshifted inflow component into the black hole. 


In the outer parts of the accretion disk, where the density is lower,
there is also a bi-conical outflow, as observed in BAL quasars.



Your phrase 
"...indicating that the BLR of the AGN is "dynamically" offset..."

is not really true. In many current models of the BLR, the region is 
not dynamically offset at all.

The accretion disk rotates around the black hole, and has exactly the same 
cosmological redshift as the host galaxy. 

Besides the dominant rotational component, there is also an inflow component, 
that shifts the peak of the line. 
The BLR lines are optically thin, so they go as density squared, 
so the line peak comes from the inner part of the accretion disk, 
where density is highest, 
and where gas flows into the black hole.


For RXJ1131, the picture is further complicated by 
the gravitational lensing, and by the microlensing:

1) MICROLENSING :

Because the NLR is big (100 pc), it is not affected by microlensing.
Because the BLR is small, it is affected by
microlensing in this quasar (Sluse et al.).

It could also be that the microlensing more strongly magnifies
the redshifted part of the BLR lines, 
biasing the apparent redshift to the red side. 



2) BLUE SIDE OF THE LINE ATTENUATED BY ABSORPTION :

Another possiblity is that the BLR shows mainly rotation 
in the accretion disk, and also a biconical outflow region
from the outer parts of the accretion disk, as in the BAL phenomenon.

Because of partial, very broad, absorption of the blueshifted flow against the 
AGN continuum, we see stronger emission from the redshifted flow.

Because the system 2 BLR lines in RXJ1131 are very wide (10000 to 20000 km/s), partial
attenuation of the blue sides of the lines could easily shift the apparent 
BLR line centroids toward the red sides of their profiles.



3) UNLIKELY RECOIL VELOCITY :

If the line-of-sight recoil velocity really were 700 km/s, then 
the true space velocity must be even higher, and certainly greater than 
the escape velocity from the host galaxy.

If it is about 1000 km/s, then the black hole moves 1 pc in 1000 years.

So in one rotation time of the host galaxy, 
or in one orbital time of the companion galaxy, 
or in the duration of the starburst, 
or in the duration of the "wet merger" 
(all of these are ~1E8 years), 
the black hole would have moved quite far away from the center of the host galaxy
(10 to 100 kpc !).

This also makes the recoil story implausible, especially for 
many other catalogued quasars and Seyfert galaxies that have differences
between the peaks of the NLR lines and the BLR lines.


------------------------------------------------------------------


TWO FURTHER SUGGESTIONS FOR SHORTENING THE PAPER:


b) ---Drop the detailed description of the best-fit procedures
(The Markov chain Monte Carlo paragraph in Sect.4.1, paragraph 3). 

c) ---Drop the details of the SED fitting procedure in Sect.4.5, 
(especially in the 2nd half of paragraph 1: 
"We impose a uniform prior"...and all the text that follows.) 


Both of these sections are very well-written, but will probably be
completely incomprehensible to many readers (including me).

I suggest that you just say that you did best fits to model the lens distribution
and best fits to the SED. 
Simply give a typical reference to the Markov chain, Monte Carlo method.


---------------------------------------------------------------------


13. FIX THE CONCLUSIONS

Sect.6, para.2: NUMBERS SLIGHTLY INCONSISTENT:

You derive M_gas = 1.38E10 Msun, 
and also M_dyn = 8E10 Msun.

So the ratio f_gas = M_gas / M_dyn = 16.6 percent, not 19 percent.

(This also has to be corrected in the Abstract, and in Sect.5.1.2, para.1).





Sect.6, para.4: DROP THE BLACK HOLE RECOIL STORY.

"...but the optical BLR lines are blueshifted by 780 km/s."

Also wrong here. The BLR lines are redshifted, not blueshifted :

BLR = 0.658 (Sect.5.3, para.1);

CO = 0.6541, NLR lines = 0.654 (Sect.5.3).

If CO(2-1) were at z = 0.658, its frequency would be 139.046 GHz.
True CO(2-1) is at z = 0.6541, so its frequency is 139.373 GHz.

So the apparent z = 0.658 is 327 MHz lower in frequency than systemic,
which corresponds to a Doppler velocity = 327 x 2.151 km/s/MHz, 

or V_doppler = 703 km/s higher in velocity (more redshifted)
than the true CO(2-1) velocity centroid at z = 0.6541.

So the BLR lines should be "redshifted by 700 km/s" (not 780 km/s).


OMIT THE REST OF THIS PARAGRAPH, 

starting with "This implies that the AGN is offset from the dynamical
center of its host galaxy." all the way to the end to the paragraph.

This is not true. The AGN could be at the center of the galaxy,
and the Doppler shift could just be a radial component (inflow),
superposed on the very fast rotational velocity of the accretion disk.

14. CHANGE FIG.9, (Left Panel) : DROP THE VELOCITY MOMENT MAP (SAME AS FIG.2)

I found Fig.9 (left) very confusing.

You should drop the velocity moment map (its the same map as in Fig.2, anyway), 
and instead, only plot the little crosses
in the source plane, on a more blown-up RA-Dec scale, so the crosses would be more visible.

The diagram is confusing because the moment map is the final observed result 
in the sky plane, after lensing, 
with lensed positions quite different from the original positions in the source plane.

Furthermore, the moment map has a weighting of velocities 
that is biased by the differential lensing, so that the 
red velocities get higher weighting than the blue velocities.

All of this distorted image in the sky plane gets even further distorted 
by convolution with the quite large 4.4" x 2.0" synthesized beam. 


The little crosses, however, are model positions (not observed data, unlike the moment map)
in the source plane (not the sky plane),
before lensing, without any intensity weighting, 
and before any convolution with the instrumental beam.

Because this figure is about the result of the best-fit lens models, and because the 
little crosses are the basis for the model p-v curve in the right panel (and not the 
contours on the moment map), 
it would be better to concentrate on the model results in the source plane,
and drop the confusing moment map in the image plane, and drop the synthesized beam ellipse.

That way, on a blown-up diagram, you would have room to put velocity labels on each of the
little crosses, so they could be more easily related to the p-v diagram in the right panel.

Could another interpretation be that instead of tracing a monotonic p-v diagram,
there are, within the errors, just two little clusters of points in the left panel?
---The upper (red wing) cluster and the lower (blue wing) cluster?
Within the errors, the 3 crosses in the red clump almost agree in position,
and the 4 crosses in the blue clump almost agree in position, as well. 

The separation between the centroids of the two clusters of points is 1 arcsec, or 7 kpc.
So if this is a central disk, then within the errors, its radius is only 3.5 kpc, not 
the 6 kpc that you quote in many places in the text.

Why do these two clusters of points in Fig.9 (left) not appear in your
p-v diagram in Fig.9 (right)?
In the right panel, why do all the little crosses seem to be evenly spaced?
Is the right panel based on an additional model of a rotating disk, rather than 
the lens model points in Fig.9 (left)?
