\section{Introduction} 
The gravitational lens RXJ 1131-1231 was discovered with spectroscopic
redshifts of the lens and the QSO are $z_{\rm L}$ = 0.295 and
$z_\textrm{AGN,HST}$ = 
0.658, respectively \citep{}

% FG gal is an elliptical gal: Slues+03 absorption lines  


As detected in the HST images, RXJ1131-1231 is a quadruply imaged AGN with
Einstein ring of size 1\farcs83 in radius. The 
background AGN is lensed into 4 point-like image A,B,C,D on a ring (emission
from the AGN host galaxy) around G, the foreground galaxy. 
C06 report the redshift of the background AGN of 0.658 with magnification ~ 9,
claimed Seyfert 1 spiral galaxy.

In this paper, we BLAH, refining the redshift to $z$=0.654
We use a cosmology WMAP9. 



\section{Observations}
\subsection{PdBI} \label{sec:PdBIdata}
Observations of the CO($J$ = 2 $\rightarrow$ 1) rotational line ($\nu_{\rm
rest}$ = 230.5379938 GHz) toward the background galaxy RXJ1131-1231 at $z$ =
0.654
 were carried out using IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI) at the
(Program ID: S14BX001; PI: D. Riechers). 
 Two observing runs were carried out on 2014 Dec 06 and 2015 Feb 05 under good
weather conditions in the C and D array configurations, respectively. The 2 mm
receivers were used to cover the redshifted CO($J$ = 2 $\rightarrow$ 1) line
and the 
underlying continuum emission (rest-frame 3.6 mm), employing
a correlator setup providing an effective bandwidth of 3.6 GHz and spectral 
resolution of 10.0 MHz ($\sim$21.5281 km s$^{-1}$).
This resulted in 3.74 hours of cumulative six antenna-equivalent on-source time
after discarding unusable visibility data.
% D: 1.5 hours; 1055+018 (BP) , 3C279 (RF, fixed flux), 1127-145 (phase/amp),
% 1124-186(ditto)
% C: 2.2 hours; MWC349 (fixed flux), 1055+018 (RF = bandpass), 1124-186
% (phase/amp), 1127-145 (ditto)
% total: 3.75 hours
%For both tracks, 
The nearby quasars 1127$-$145 and 1124$-$186 were observed every 22 minutes
for
pointing, secondary amplitude, and phase calibration and 1055$+$018 was
observed as bandpass calibrators 
for both tracks.
MWC349 and 3C279 were observed
as the primary
absolute flux calibrator for C and D array observations, respectively, yielding
$\lesssim
$15\% calibration accuracy.

The GILDAS package was used to reduce and analyze the visibility data which are
then imaged and deconvolved using
the CLEAN algorithm with ``natural" weighting. This yields a synthesized clean
beam size of 4$\farcs$44 $\times$ 1\farcs95 (PA: 13\degr). The final rms noise
is $\sigma$ =
0.177 
Jy km s$^{-1}$ beam$^{-1}$ over a channel width of 320 MHz (corresponding to
690 km s$^{-1}$), and $\sigma$ = 1.451 Jy km s$^{-1}$ beam$^{-1}$ over 10 MHz 
(21.5 km s$^{-1}$) . 
The continuum image is created by % 2.152 mm; 
averaging over all the line-free channels ($\nu_{\rm cont}\sim$139 GHz). This
yields an rms noise of 0.082 mJy beam$^{-1}$. % see README.md in 04Sep15

Observations of the CO($J$ = 3 $\rightarrow$ 2) rotational line ($\nu_{\rm
rest}$ = 345.7959899 GHz) 
%toward the background galaxy RXJ1131-1231 at $z$ = 0.654
 were carried out using the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave
Astronomy (CARMA; Program ID: cf0098; PI: D. Riechers) on 2014 February 17 
under good 3 mm weather
conditions and on 2014 February 02 under terrible 3mm weather in the D array
configurations.  The 3 mm receivers were used to cover
the 
redshifted CO($J$ = 3 $\rightarrow$ 2) line, employing a correlator setup
providing a bandwidth of 3.75 GHz in each sideband and spectral resolution of
12.5 MHz ($
\sim$17.9 km s$^{-1}$). The line was placed in the
lower sidebands with the local oscillator tuned to $\nu_{\rm LO}\sim$ 216 GHz;
this resulted in 2.94 hours of 15 antenna-equivalent on-source time after
flagging poor visibility data. 
The radio quasars 3C273 and J1127-189 was observed every 15 minutes for
pointing, amplitude, and phase calibration. Mars was observed as the
primary
absolute flux calibrator and 3C279 was observed as bandpass calibrators for
both tracks. 
% poor phase note
Since the phase calibrator from the first track is faint and was observed under
poor weather and the phase calibrator used for the second track was
far from our target source.
Hence, the phase calibration was 
subpar, with rms scatter $\sim$ 60\degr. 
We estimate $\sim
$BLAH\% calibration accuracy based on the flux scale uncertainties, gain variation over time, and 
the calibrated phase scatter.
The MIRIAD package was used to calibrate and analyze the visibility data which
are imaged and deconvolved using
the CLEAN algorithm with ``natural" weighting. This yields a synthesized clean
beam size of 3\farcs2 $\times$ 1\farcs9 (PA: 8\degr) for the lower sideband
image cube. The
final 
rms noise is $\sigma$ = 13.3 mJy km s$^{-1}$ beam$^{-1}$ over a channel width
of
25 MHz (corresponding to 35.87 km s$^{-1}$). 

\subsection{VLA} 
% 20081229
% flux 1331+305
% phase 1130-149

Observations of the radio continuum toward the
galaxy RXJ1131-1231 were carried out using the {\it Karl G. Jansky} Very Large 
Array (VLA; Program ID: AW741; PI: Wucknitz).
Observations were carried out on BLAH under excellent/GOOD? weather
conditions in the A array configurations. The C-Band receivers were used to 
cover the BLAH
, employing a correlator setup providing a bandwidth of BLAH GHz in each
sideband. This resulted in BLAH hours of BLAH antenna-equivalent on-source time
after 
discarding unusable visibility data.

The nearby radio quasar BLAH was observed every BLAH minutes for
pointing, amplitude, and phase calibration, and BLAH was observed as the
primary
absolute flux calibrator. BLAH were observed as bandpass calibrators, yielding
$\sim
$15\% calibration accuracy.
The AIPS package was used to calibrate and analyze the visibility data which
are imaged and deconvolved using
the CLEAN algorithm with ``natural" weighting. This yields a synthesized clean
beam size of 2$\farcs$6 $\times$ 2\farcs2 for the continuum image. The final
rms 
noise is $\sigma$ = 0.68 Jy km s$^{-1}$ beam$^{-1}$.

\section{HST astrometry}
We adopt the VLA 5\,GHz map of BLAH resolution as the reference coordinate frame and align the optical image. We shifted the 
latter to the east by 0\farcs5963 in R.A and +0\farcs8372 in declination., which is consistent with the typical astrometric precision of the HST image. 
The radio image is calibrated employing well-monitored phase calibrator, with positions known to $\sim$1 mas. 
We estimate the absolute alignment of the 5 GHz and CO(J=2-1) coordinate frames should
be better than 0.1", leaving aside uncertainties relating to the SNR and beam size.


%The astrometry of the HST images was firstly calibrated against a wider-field
%optical image of the cluster which had in turn been aligned onto the FK5
%coordinate system to an rms precision of ~0.2".

We detect unresolved CO($J$ = 3 $\rightarrow$ 2) line emission toward the
background galaxies in RXJ1131-1231.
We extract the spectrum and fit a single-component Gaussian as shown in Figure
\ref{fig:co32spec}
yielding peak flux density of 57.8 $\pm$ 10.7 mJy, the FWHM of the Gaussian fit
is 608 $\pm$ 57 km s$^{-1}$. The integrated line flux is 37.509$\pm$ 2.24 Jy km/s, this does not include the uncertainties in the calibration.

At spatial position of CO emission, No significant continuum emission was
detected from the line-free channels down to a 3$\sigma$ limit of 2.49mJy Beam\pmOne.

We detect dynamically resolved CO($J$ = 2 $\rightarrow$ 1) line emission toward
the background galaxies in RXJ1131-1231. 

We construct the velocity-integrated (0th moment) map of the CO($J$ = 2
$\rightarrow$ 1) emission using the uv-continuum subtracted data, the
velocity-integrated 
CO($J$ = 2 $\rightarrow$ 1) line flux is 20.3 $\pm$ 0.2 Jy km s$^{-1}$.

We place an upper limit on \rot[HNC]{2}{1} line emission at the red-shifted frequency 140 GHz in the foreground galaxy at $z\sim$0.295) of $\sigma$ = 1.451mJy per channel per beam. Assuming a typical line width of 300 \kms, this corresponds to a 3$\sigma$ limit of 4.353 mJy \kms beam\pmOne.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% VLA C Band
%

VLA C Band continuum image shows resolved jets and core emission from the foreground lensing galaxy as well as the background lensed quasar (as arcs). We extracted the 5GHz fluxes for the arcs and the core as listed in Table \ref{tab:photometry}.

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:cont}, we detect 2mm continuum emission toward both the foreground galaxy and the background as lensed emission.  
The integrated continuum flux density is 1.2 mJy, while the peak emission is centered on the foreground galaxy at $S_\nu$ of 8 \micron Jy beam\pmOne.  The detection is hence marginally resolved along one axis as shown in Figure \ref{fig:contco21}. 
We attempted to extract the background emission by subtracting the foreground emission as modeled by a point source (unresolved). But the residual after removing a point source model is just noise. So we I guess if we take the difference between the integrated and the  peak in the image plane is an upper limit to the background source at 2mm, which is $\sim$ 0.4 mJy.

We fit power law to the VLA radio data and the 2mm continuum, we derive a spectral index of $\alpha$=0.025.

\section{\rot{2}{1} Lens model}

\subsection{interpretation}
- C06 suggest the presence of an interacting dusty galaxy in their HST
observations, which BJB+08 calls it the F component. The lensed images of the
ABCDE 
components coincide with our CO data (see mom0 on HST and channel map),
evidently CO emission coming from the AGN host galaxy. 
- one of the red channels in our lens model suggests a second source component,
which is consistent with the spatially offset dusty source (see mom0 on HST,
which 
the red velocity component coincides with this F component)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
We compare our lens model parameters on the mass distribution of the lensing
galaxy with literature, particularly against the SIE model presented by C06. 
In C06, their SIE model shows position of lensing mass is offset by (-0.015",
-0.041" from obsservations (i.e. light centroid)); PA = -73.6, ellipticity = 0.45,
theta\_R = 1.84" $\pm$ 0.01. 
Our best-fit model parameters finds a BLAH
	- Our model lens parameters (median):
		- file: WRITEUP/MedianLensModelParams.txt
		- lensing gal. position is consistent with C06, 
		- Einstein radius: consistent with C06
		- PA: consistent within errors
		- Axial ratio: consistent within errors
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Differential lensing is at play as suggested by the spectral shape of the \rot{2}{1} line profile, where 
flux density in the red wing is much high than in the blue wing.  
We modelled the emission using different kinematic components, the magnification factors are reported in Table BLAH.

\section{SED}

We fit SED models to the photometry of dust emission in RXJ1131-1231 with a power-law attached to the blue side and including the 24.0\micron data from Spitzer/MIPS to constrain the dust peak. 
Also do SED fit with IRAS upper limits.
