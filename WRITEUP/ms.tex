\section{Introduction}
We use a concordance $\Lambda$CDM cosmology throughout this paper, with parameters from the WMAP9 results:
$H_0$ = 70 \kms Mpc\pmOne, $\Omega_{\rm M}$ = 0.27, and $\Omega_{\Lambda}$ = 0.7 \citep{Hinshaw13a}.

\section{Observations}
\subsection{PdBI \bco} % DONE
Observations of the \bco rotational line ($\nu_{\rm rest}$ = 230.5379938 GHz)
toward the \gl galaxy RXJ1131-1231 at $z_{\rm QSO}$\,=\,0.658
were carried out using IRAM \pdbi (PdBI; Program ID: S14BX001; PI: D.
Riechers). Two observing runs were carried out on 2014 December 06 and 2015
February 05 under good weather conditions in the C and D array configurations,
respectively. The 2 mm receivers were used to cover the redshifted \bco line
and the underlying continuum emission, employing a correlator setup providing
an effective bandwidth of 3.6 GHz and a spectral resolution of 10.0 MHz ($\sim$
21.5 \kms). This resulted in 3.75 hours of cumulative six antenna-equivalent on-source
 time after discarding unusable visibility data.
The nearby quasars 1127$-$145 and 1124$-$186 were observed every 22 minutes
for pointing, secondary amplitude, and phase calibration and 1055$+$018 was
observed as bandpass calibrators for both tracks.
MWC349 and 3C279 were observed as the primary flux calibrator for C and D
array observations, respectively, yielding $\lesssim$15\% calibration accuracy.

The \ncode{GILDAS} package was used to reduce and analyze the visibility data
which are then imaged and deconvolved using the CLEAN algorithm with ``natural"
weighting. This yields a synthesized clean beam size of 4$\farcs$44 $\times$ 1\farcs95 (PA = 13\degr).
The final rms noise is $\sigma$ = 1.451 mJy \kms
beam\pmOne over 10 MHz (21.5 \kms). The continuum image at $\nu_{\rm cont}\sim$139\,GHz
is created by averaging over all the line-free channels. This
yields an rms noise of 0.082 mJy beam$^{-1}$. % see README.md in 04Sep15

\subsection{CARMA \cco} %DONE
Observations of the \cco rotational line ($\nu_{\rm rest}$ = 345.7959899 GHz)
were carried out under the D array configurations of the \carma (CARMA;
Program ID: cf0098; PI: D. Riechers) on 2014 February 02 under terrible 1.5\,mm
weather conditions and on 2014 February 17 under good 1.5\,mm
weather conditions. The correlator setup provides a bandwidth of 3.75 GHz in
each sideband and a spectral resolution of 12.5 MHz ($\sim$17.9 \kms). The
line was placed in the lower sideband with the local oscillator tuned to $\nu_{\rm LO}\sim$216 GHz. The radio quasars J1127$-$189 (first track) and 3C273
(second track) were observed
every 15 minutes for pointing, amplitude, and phase calibration. Mars was
observed as the primary absolute flux calibrator and 3C279 was observed as
bandpass calibrators for both tracks. This results in a total on-source time of 2.94 hours after flagging poor
visibility data.

Given that the phase calibrator used for the first track was faint and was
observed under poor weather conditions and that the phase calibrator used for
the second track was far from our target source, the phase calibration is
subpar, with an rms scatter $\sim$60\degr. We thus conservatively estimate
a calibration accuracy of $\sim$45\% based on the flux scale uncertainties,
the gain variations over time, and the phase scatter on the calibrated data. We
therefore treat its line intensity with caution and ensure that any physical interpretation
of this system (and thus implications and conclusions of this paper) do not rely on this quantity.

The \ncode{MIRIAD} package was used to calibrate the visibility data which are
then imaged and deconvolved using the CLEAN algorithm with ``natural" weighting. This yields a synthesized clean
beam size of 3\farcs2 $\times$ 1\farcs9 (PA = 8\degr) for the lower sideband
image cube. The final rms noise is $\sigma$ = 13.3 mJy km s$^{-1}$ beam$^{-1}$
over a channel width of 25 MHz. An rms noise of
$\sigma$ = 0.831 mJy beam\pmOne is reached by averaging over the
line-free channels.

\subsection{VLA} %DONE
Our analysis also use the archival data of the radio continuum obtained with the \vla (VLA; Program ID: AW741; PI: Wucknitz). Since these data have not been
published, we here describe the details of the observations as well as our calibration steps.

Observations were carried out on 2008 December 29 under excellent weather
conditions in the A array configurations for a total of $\sim$7 hours on-source time. The C$-$band receivers were used with a continuum mode setup,
providing a bandwidth of 50 MHz in each sideband.
The nearby radio quasar 1130$-$149 was observed every 10 minutes for
pointing, amplitude, and phase calibration, 1331$-$305 was observed as the
primary flux calibrator, and 0319$+$415 was observed as the bandpass
calibrator, yielding $\sim$10\% calibration accuracy.
We use \aips to calibrate the visibility data which
are then imaged and deconvolved using
the CLEAN algorithm using robust\,=\,0. This yields a synthesized clean
beam size of 0$\farcs$49 $\times$ 0\farcs35 (PA\,=\,0\farcs18) and a final
rms noise of $\sigma$ = 13 $\mu$Jy beam\pmOne.


\section{HST astrometry} %DONE
We obtain HST images from the Hubble Legacy Archive with
a goal to understand the origins of the emission detected
in our mm observations. We adopt the VLA 5\,GHz map of $\sim$0\farcs5
resolution as the reference coordinate frame to align the optical (V$-$band) image.
We shift the latter to the east by 0\farcs5963 in R.A. and $+$0\farcs8372 in
Dec., which is consistent with the typical astrometric precision (1$-$2") of
images from the Hubble Legacy Archive\footnote{http://hla.stsci.edu/hla\_faq.
html}. Such astrometric correction is critical to avoid artificial spatial
offsets between different emitting regions and to carry out our lens modeling,
in which the absolute position of the foreground lensing galaxy is guided by its
coordinates in the optical image, where its emission is clearly detected.
The VLA image is calibrated using a well-monitored phase
calibrator, with absolute positional accuracy of $\sim$2 mas.
For this reason, the absolute alignment between the VLA image and other
interferometric images reported in this paper are expected to have astrometric
precision better than 0\farcs1, modulo uncertainties related to the SNR, phase
errors, and beam size.

\section{Results}
\subsection{\bco Emission} \label{sec:CO21} %DONE
We dynamically resolved the \bco line emission toward the background galaxies
at $\gtrsim$27$\sigma$ significance, confirming the redshift at $z_{\rm CO}$ =
0.65370 $\pm$ 0.0005. A highly asymmetric double-horned line profile is
detected as shown in \Fig{CO21spec}. Fitting a double Gaussian results in peak
flux densities of 75.3$\pm$2.6 and 24.0$\pm$2.0 mJy, and a FWHM of
179$\pm$9 \kms and 255$\pm$28 \kms, respectively. The peaks are separated by
$\Delta v_{\rm sep}$ = 220 \kms. The integrated line flux is 24.1\,$\pm$\,2.3 Jy \kms. % see 15May16/

\Sec{differential} and the magnification factors for various kinematic

%   - note that theoretical sigma is lower = 1.5 * sqrt(160-126+1) * 21.5 ~ 0.2 Jy km/s /beam, due to higher noise in some channels with emission
We construct the zeroth, first and second moment maps shown in \Fig{CO21mom}
using the $uv$-continuum subtracted data cube, over $\Delta v$$\sim$750 \kms.
The first and second moment maps are clipped at 3$\sigma$.
The peak flux density is 8.12 $\pm$ 0.30 Jy\,\kms\,beam\pmOne in the intensity-integrated
map. The deconvolved source size is estimated to be 5\farcs1$\pm$0\farcs72 $\times$ 3\farcs72$\pm$0\farcs66
and thus the emission is resolved over $\sim$2.2 beams.
While the lensed emission is not strictly distributed as 2D-Gaussian,
the fit recovers the line intensity enclosed within the emitting
region, we therefore take this as an estimate on the extent of the lensed
emission. On the other hand, if we assume the spatial distribution of
the lensed molecular gas emission is similar to that in the optical to \nir
wavelengths, the lensed emission would be more accurately described by an
annulus, enclosing the partially complete ``Einstein Ring" and
the lensed knots (see \Fig{CO21mom}).

location of the foreground galaxy at $z$\,=\,0.295. Right: contours
are color-coded to represent the red and blue wings of the emission.
\label{fig:CO21mom}}
\end{figure}

The emission of the red component coincides with the Einstein Ring seen in the
optical image, with most of its apparent flux originating from the lensed arc
in the Southeast, whereas the blue component is predominately coming from
solely the lensed arc shown in \Fig{CO21mom}. To illustrate this, we show the
channel maps of 21.5\,\kms width and spatial spectra of 1\farcs5 resolution in
\Fig{chanmap} and \Fig{spatialSpec}, respectively. The figures show that emission
is present to the West and peaks toward the lensing arc (black across in \Fig{chanmap})
in the red wing, and shifts to the East with decreasing velocity (blue wing).
This indicates extended emission in the source plane, where
emission from different kinematic components is separated by different amounts
relative to the caustics. One consequence of such is the observed asymmetric
line profile. A detailed analysis on differential lensing of \bco is presented in \Sec{differential}.

$\sigma$ = 1.451mJy per channel beam\pmOne.
Assuming a typical line width of 300 \kms, this corresponds to a 3$\sigma$
limit of 4.353 mJy \kms beam\pmOne.

\subsection{Origin of the \bco emission} \label{sec:origin} %DONE
Evidently, the CO emission is co-spatial with the lensed optical emission in
the background AGN host galaxy. The question is then whether the optically
faint companion also contributes to the CO flux and thus contains a
non-negligible amount of molecular gas.
Indeed, based on our lens model presented in \Sec{lensmodel}, we find it
highly likely that part of the CO emission originates from
the companion. We thus classify RXJ1131 as a ``wet-wet'' merger.
However, we cannot quantify this with a mass ratio given the
spatial resolution. This will be verified in future higher-resolution observations.
In the subsequent sections, we will interpret RXJ1131
assuming this classification (i.e. a ``wet-wet'' merger).

\subsection{\bco Kinematics} % DONE
A clear velocity gradient and an unusually high
velocity dispersion ($\gtrsim$400\kms) near the central region
is seen in \Fig{CO21highO}. While beam smearing is inevitably the
dominant factor in the observed velocity dispersion
at the spatial resolution of this data, the exceedingly
high velocity dispersion hints
at potential perturbations from the AGN, or internal turbulence due to
interactions with the companion, and/or instability due to the large gas
content. A velocity gradient across the source plane in \Fig{model} is also
found in our lens model. This further supports the idea of a
kinematically-ordered galaxy, but its emission has been lensed differentially.
In this scenario, RXJ1131 is a disrupted disk galaxy hosting an optically
bright quasar and is in the process of merging.
We will defer the discussion of its implications to \Sec{dynamics},
where we analyze the dynamics of the system in the source plane.

50 \kms, and 100 \kms, respectively. The beam (native resolution) is shown in the right panel.
\label{fig:CO21highO}}
\end{figure}


\subsection{\cco Emission} % DONE
We detect resolved \cco line emission toward RXJ1131. The spectrum is shown in
\Fig{co32spec}, which seems to have a double-peak profile.
This is expected if RXJ1131 is truly a disk galaxy (see previous
sections). The high phase noise in the calibration leads to a low SNR
detection. We thus estimate the line intensity to be
35.7$\pm$ 21.9 Jy\,\kms by summing up fluxes over the
linewidth used to infer \bco line intensity ($\sim$700 \kms).

\begin{figure}[!Htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.455\textwidth]{../Figures/coOverlay.eps}
\caption{CARMA \cco line profile (solid) without continuum subtraction is
over-plotted on the continuum-subtracted \bco line profile (dashed).
The velocity scale is with respect to $z$=0.6537, which corresponds to the
dynamical center of the \bco line. The spectral resolution for \cco and \bco
is 35.8 \kms and 21.5 \kms, respectively.
 \label{fig:co32spec}}
\end{figure}

Assuming the spatial extents between \bco and \cco are similar and therefore
a negligible differential lensing effect, the line intensities
correspond to a brightness temperature ratio of
$r_{\rm 32}$\,=\,T$_{\tiny \cco}$/T$_{\tiny \bco}$\,=\,0.66\,$\pm$\,0.41.
The high uncertainty is dominated by the uncertainties in the \cco line
intensity.

\subsection{Interferometric Continuum} %DONE
No 1.5\,mm continuum emission is detected at the position of \cco
down to a 3$\sigma$ limit of 2.49mJy beam\pmOne.
This is consistent with the spectrum shown in \Fig{co32spec}.

We detect PdBI 2\,mm continuum in \Fig{cont}. The integrated flux density is
1.2$\pm$0.2 mJy, with a peak flux $S_\nu$ = 800$\pm$88 \micron Jy\,beam\pmOne
centering on the lensing galaxy. A slightly extended emission is also seen
along the lensed arc. This suggests that the detected emission comes from
both the foreground galaxy and the background galaxy and that the
emission is marginally resolved along its major axis.
We subtract a point source model in $uv$-plane to remove the unresolved
emission toward the foreground galaxy. The peak flux (0.389$\pm$0.082 mJy)
in the residual map coincides with the lensed arc, and is consistent with
the difference between the integrated and the peak flux in the
original continuum map ($\sim$0.4 mJy). We therefore adopt
$S_\nu$ = 0.39$\pm$0.08 mJy as the 2\,mm continuum emission toward
the background galaxy.

$\sigma_{\rm 5GHz}$\,=\,13 $\mu$Jy beam\pmOne in the left and right panel, respectively.
The central crosses indicate the centroid of the foreground galaxy,
as detected in the optical image. The synthesis beams are shown in the bottom left corner of each panel.
\label{fig:cont}}\vspace{0.51em}
\end{figure}

The VLA C-band continuum image in \Fig{cont} shows resolved emission from the
jets and core of the foreground elliptical galaxy
as well as emission toward the background quasar.
Multiple peaks are seen along the arc and their centroids
coincide with the optical emission from the quasar.
We extract the flux densities for the arc and the core in \Tab{photometry}.
We find a spectral index of $\alpha$\,=\,0.024 for the foreground
galaxy and $\alpha$\,=\,0.345 for the background galaxy by fitting a
power-law (S$_\nu \propto \nu^{-\alpha}$) to the continuum emission at
5\,GHz and 2\,mm.

\subsection{Photometry} \label{sec:photometry} %DONE
We compile \mir to \fir broadband photometry from various
catalogs available on the NASA/IPAC Infrared Science
Archive (IRSA) in \Tab{photometry}. These data were obtained from
the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS; \citealt{Skrutskie06a}),
Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE; \citealt{Wright10a}),
{\it Infrared Astronomical Satellite} (IRAS; \citealt{Neugebauer84a}), and
the Multiband Imaging Photometer (MIPS; \citealt{Rieke04a}) and
Mid-infrared Infrared Array Camera (IRAC; \citealt{Fazio04a}) on
\spitzer. We retrieve PBCD (level 2) {\it Spitzer}/IRAC images from the
Spitzer Heritage Archive. We perform aperture photometry on
the channel 1 image to extract flux density at 3.6\,$\mu$m
since it is not available from the IRSA archive.

The emission in the IRAC images is slightly extended. We thus use the
HST image ($\sim$0\farcs07 resolution) to determine
origins of their centroids, all of which are found to be
centered at the position corresponding to the lensed emission from the
background galaxy. To recover the diffuse background emission, we subtract a
point source model centered on the lensing galaxy. We use the average
FWHM found by fitting a Gaussian profile to several field stars
using \ncode{imexam} routine of IRAF.
We perform aperture photometry on the residual image
to obtain decomposed flux measurements from the background galaxy.
The photometries for the foreground galaxy are then obtained
by subtracting the fluxes decomposed for the background source
from the observed total flux. The resulting photometry in
\Tab{photometry} are obtained after performing aperture correction
described in the IRAC Instrument Handbook\footnote{http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/SPITZER/docs/irac/iracinstrumenthandbook/} to
correct for the fact that the IRAC imaging was calibrated
using a 12" aperture, which is bigger than the aperture (5\farcs8) we used to
perform aperture photometry. This step was taken to provide
constraints on the Wien tail beyond the dust peak of the
spectral energy distribution (SED) of RXJ1131.
The details of the SED modeling is presented in \Sec{SED}.

Extraction of the {\it Herschel}/SPIRE photometry was
carried out using SUSSEXTractor within Herschel Interactive
Processing Environment (HIPE; \citealt{Ott10a})
over the Level 2 maps obtained from the Herschel Science Archive.
These maps were processed by the SPIRE pipeline
version 13.0 within HIPE. The SUSSEXtractor task estimates
the flux density from an image convolved with a kernel
derived from the SPIRE beam. The flux density
measured by SUSSEXtractor is additionally confirmed
using the Timeline Fitter. This task performs photometry
by fitting a 2D elliptical Gaussian to the Level 1 data at the
source position given by the output of SUSSEXtractor.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Analysis}
\subsection{Lens modeling} \label{sec:lensmodel}
At the angular resolution of the \bco data, the images are resolved
but not within the multiply lensed emission (i.e., sub-optimal for
performing lens modeling). Nevertheless, the high spectral
resolution of this data provides dynamical information on
spatial scales smaller than the beam (see \Fig{CO21highO}).
Hence, with the high SNR, we reconstruct the intrinsic gas
dynamics by carrying out parametric lens modeling over different
channel slices of the interferometric data using our lensing code
\uvmcmcfit (\citealt{uvmcmcfit15a};see \citealt{Bussmann15a} for details of
the code). Model of each slice in \Fig{model} thus provides
properties on the intrinsic kinematics. The slices
are obtained by binning the data (over the full linewidth
$\sim$700\kms; see \Sec{CO21}) by five channels (i.e., into seven slices)
 to increase the SNR.

The lens mass distribution is modeled using a singular isothermal
ellipsoid (SIE) profile, which is described by five free parameters: the
positional offset in R.A. and Dec. relative to an arbitrary chosen
fixed coordinate in the image, the Einstein Radius, the axial ratio, and the
position angle. We use the VLA radio continuum emission toward
the foreground galaxy to initialize the positional offset. We impose a
uniform prior $\pm$0\farcs05 in both $\Delta$R.A. and $\Delta$Dec., which is
larger than the astrometry uncertainties in the VLA image and is
constrained by the uncertainties provided from previous SIE lens model (C06).
We initialize the Einstein Radius based on the optical SIE lens
model by C06 and impose a uniform prior using their reported $\pm$3$\sigma$.
The sources are modeled using elliptical Gaussian profiles, which are
parameterized by six free parameters: the positional offset in R.A.
and Dec. relative to the lens, the intrinsic flux density, the effective
radius, the axial ratio, and the position angle. The position of each source
is allowed to vary between $\pm$1\farcs5 (i.e., within the Einstein Radius)
and the effective radius is allowed to vary from 0\farcs01$-$2".

% Check with Shane
Our code uses an Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to sample the
posterior probability distribution function (PDF). In each model, we employ
$\sim$50,000 samples as the initial ``burn-in'' stage to stabilize the Markov
chains (which we then discard). We use the final $\sim$5,000
samplings to determine the posterior probability distributions. Here, we
identify the best-fit model and the quoted uncertainties using the
median and the 68\% confidence intervals in the marginal PDFs.

We first obtain a preliminary lens model for each channel slice independently,
where their lens parameters are allowed to vary and are initialized according
to the aforementioned way. We obtain the final model
by repeating the modeling over each slice but fixing their lens parameters
according to the overall median in the preliminary models
(see \Tab{lens}). This ensures the
lens model of each kinematic component share the same lens profile.
The magnification factor is determined by taking the ratio
between the image plane flux of the model and the source plane flux.
The source positions and magnification factors are listed in \Tab{model}.

% disk and caveat
The location of the reconstructed sources in \Fig{model} are consistent with
of a disk. This in essence demonstrate a velocity field in the source plane.
 While solely based on the lens model would not be sufficient to
draw such conclusion/assertion. Yet, with the observed velocity gradient.
We emphasis that the spatial resolution of is a few arcsec, which means that
although we have high SNR and spectral resolution, this data is not sufficient
to constrain the intrinsic sizes of the lensed galaxies, and thus underpredict
the magnification factors. We will discuss this further in the following
section.

\end{figure*}



\subsubsection{Differential Lensing} \label{sec:differential}
Lens modeling of this source from previous studies find non-negligible differential lensing effect across H-Band, V-band, and I-band. The magnification factor ranges from 10.9
to 7.8, where the decrease is caused
by the more extended IR emission (hence \SF), well beyond the caustic (C06).

The highly asymmetric \bco line profile also suggests that differential lensing is non-negligible in the CO emission, where
flux density in the red wing is apparently much higher than in the blue wing, given its lensing configuration.
By modeling different kinematic components, we find that the magnification factor ranges from BLAH to BLAH. The various magnification factors are listed in \Tab{mag}.

\subsection{\bco Dynamical modeling} \label{sec:dynamics}
Based on the the source plane position of each kinematic components from the
lens model, a clear symmetric velocity gradient is seen, which is suggestive of a rotating disk. Assuming the observed velocities of the respective channels
correspond to solely the tangential components (i.e. $\theta$ = 0), we extract
the major axis along the best-fit slice across these source plane positions,
which is along PA of 121\degr.
We attempt to characterize the molecular gas kinematics using an empirically motivated disk model (e.g. Courteau97, Peuch+08, Miller+11):
\begin{equation}
V = V_0 + \frac{2}{\pi} V_{\rm a} \arctan(\frac{R}{R_{\rm t}}),
\end{equation}
where $V$ is the observed velocity, $V_0$ is the velocity at dynamical center, $V_{\rm a}$ is the asymptotic velocity, and $R_{\rm t}$ is the ``turnover'' radius at which the rotation curve
becomes flat. We perform non-linear least square fitting using an orthogonal distance regression to find the best-fit $V_a$, $r_t$, $V_0$, taking into account
errors in both velocity and distance offset (see \Fig{PV}). We also place an upper limit on $r_t$ $<$ 15 kpc (Miller+11, Genzel+??, Puech+08?) to keep this
parameter physical. We then estimate the uncertainties associated with best-fit parameters using a Monte Carlo simulation of 500 iterations, perturbing
the velocity and physical separation according to a random Gaussian distribution of width/sigma based on the input uncertainties on
the data. Using this model, we find $V_a$ = 975$\pm$387, $r_t$ = 10.6$\pm$5.7,
and $V_0$ = 28$\pm$40. We note, however, that since emission is not detected beyond the flat regime of the rotation curve (Figure \ref{fig: PV}), the asymptotic velocity is
poorly constrained. In particular, $V_a$ and $r_t$ are highly correlated with a Pearson coefficient $r$ = 0.998 between the two, and 0.027 between $V_a$ and $V_0$.

While a symmetric velocity field in the source plane is consistent with a rotating disc, such is insufficient to conclude a rotating disk morphology. Additional characteristics such
as peak velocity dispersion at the center of a galaxy and a ``spider'' diagram are needed. Based on the reconstructed source plane in the optical/NIR emission, C06 find that a
n=1 Sersic profile is best fit their model or is it the reconstructed emission (TBD).

The frequently used V$_{\rm max}$ (maximum measured velocity) is not equivalent to the
asymptotic value, Va, a mathematical extrapolation and typically not reached in
the observed rotation curve. Estimates of Va can depend critically on how well
the central region and turn over of the rotation curve are constrained. For the
remaining analysis, we adopt the asymptotic limit as a proxy to the rotation
curve. We also note that typical studies of the Tully-Fisher relation uses V$_2.2$ (at 2.2 $\times$ disc scalelength $\sim$ 1.375 half-light radius $\sim$ 0.7R$_opt$) as the rotation
velocity since this would be the radius at which the velocity of a pure
exponential disc peaks at. However, our source appears to be a disturbed
rotator, albeit coarse resolution. Hence, rather than adopting V$_2.2$, we use the
asymptotic value from the best-fit arctangent model. The half light radius in the
optical is ~xx kpc (from C06; converted in to our cosmology, but BJB 8 kpc
across?).

If we adopt the best-fit parameters, we find a dynamical mass of $M_{\rm dyn}$($<$blah kpc) sin$^2 i$ = BLAH \Msun. Consider the line widths using the separation between
the red- and blue- shifted emission of the \bco line profile of $\Delta v_{\rm sep}/2 \sim$ blah \kms and a source size of blah kpc, we find a dynamical mass of $M_{\rm dyn}$
sin$^2 i$ = BLAH \Msun. If we adopt the inclination angle using the morphological axis ratio from the
reconstructed optical image reported by C06, where the minor axis is 1\farcs8 and the major axis is 3\farcs3.25, then we find an inclination angle of 56.4
\degr. Then $M_{\rm dyn}$\,=\,BLAH. The inclination angle is consistent with the observed unobscured AGN and an observable double peak line profile.

We note, however, that large differences (up to $\gtrsim$10 deg) can be found between such kinematically-derived inclinations and the ones inferred from the morphological
axis ratio (e.g., Chemin et al. 2006). We caution that this analysis is based on limited spatial resolution data and will been verified by future higher-resolution observations.

\subsection{SED modeling} \label{sec:SED}
We extrapolated a power-law to 24 \micron to decompose the flux
at 24 \micron in MIPS.

We fit modified blackbody functions to
to constrain the dust temperature, \fir (rest-frame 42.5-122.5 \micron) luminosity, dust mass (For the mass absorption coefficient we adopt κν = 2.64 m2 kg−1 at 125 μm (rest frame; Dunne et al. 2003).)
We added blah\% calibration uncertainties on the PdBI data.

We check convergence of our chains by requiring that the autocorrelation length for each model parameter is several times less than the number of steps taken during an initial burn-in stage (which are then discarded).
Compared with the version of this code used by Riechers et al. (2013), several improvements have been made. First, we have added the ability to impose upper and lower limits as well as Gaussian priors on the model parameters. These additions are useful for analyzing poorly constrained data, such as when we consider fits to only the SPIRE photometry in Section 3. Second, instead of treating the instrument response as a delta function in wavelength, we now fully model the wavelength response of each instrument. We have applied this improved code to FLS 3, and find that the resulting changes in the model parameters are well within the quoted uncertainties.

% upper limit using decomposed 24 um
% lower limit using fit without 24 um, but do I still want to fit a power-law for this?
The best-fit SEDs are shown in \Fig{SED} and the resulting parameters (inferred from the BLAH of the posterior PDF) are listed in \Tab{SED}.
% parameter estimation problem
For these parameter estimation problems using MCMC to sample,
the full answer is the full joint posterior PDF.
We here report the summary statistics (global mode (where min. chi),
marginal mode (in log file),
posterior median (instead of posterior means; need to compute) and the 1$\sigma$ confidence intervals in the marginal PDF) to reflect the PDF shape.



\subsection{ISM properties}
We correct for lensing magnification using the median among our models ($\mu_{\rm L}$=BLAH).
Assuming a Salpeter initial mass function, we find the SFR of blah using the \fir luminosity after corrected for lensing .

gas fraction at this redshift. how does that relate to
the SFH, and the change in cosmic SFD is due to change in gas content.
SFE at this redshift, how does that relate to the SFH. probably a secondary effect to the drop in SFH

\section{Summary and Conclusions}
We observed the cold molecular gas properties using \bco and \cco line emission
toward the AGN host galaxy RXJ1131 at $z_{\rm CO}$\,$\sim$0.65.
Our results suggest that RXJ1131 is a wet-wet merger between a AGN/starburst
ULIRG and a optically faint companion.
