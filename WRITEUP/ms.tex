\section{Introduction}

In this paper, we explore the ISM properties of the quadruply imaged
quasar RXS J113151.62-123158 (hereafter RXJ1131) at
$z_\textrm{AGN}$\,$=$\,0.685, with an Einstein ring of size
1\farcs83 in radius. The foreground lensing
galaxy is an elliptical galaxy at $z_\textrm{L}$\,$=$\,0.295. The redshifts
are spectroscopically confirmed by \citet{Sluse03a}.
A black hole mass estimate of M$_{\rm BH}$\,$<$\,2\E{8}\Msun
is also reported based on X-ray observations \citep{Reis14a}.
\defcitealias{Sluse03a}{S03}

This paper is structured as follows.
In \Sec{obs} and \Sec{HST}, we outline the details of the observations and data reduction process.
In \Sec{results}, we report the measurements of the CO lines and photometry from optical to radio wavelengths.
In \Sec{anal}, we represent our dynamical lens modeling on the \bco data and the physical properties inferred for  RXJ1131.
In \Sec{diss}, we discuss the results and implications of this study in the context of molecular gas evolution in mergers and massive galaxies.
Finally, we summarize the main results of this study and present our conclusions in \Sec{sum}.
We use a concordance $\Lambda$CDM cosmology throughout this paper, with
parameters from the WMAP9 results:
$H_0$ = 69.32 \kms Mpc\pmOne, $\Omega_{\rm M}$ = 0.29, and
$\Omega_{\Lambda}$ = 0.71 \citep{Hinshaw13a}.
% same as LR16a: i.e. use last column (WMAP+eCMB+BAO+H0) of Tab 4 in Hinshaw+13 because that's what astropy use for WMAP9 as cosmo

\section{Observations} \label{sec:obs}
\subsection{PdBI \bco} % DONE
Observations of the \bco rotational line
($\nu_{\rm rest}$\,=\,230.5379938 GHz; $\nu_{\rm obs}$\,=\,139.4\,GHz)
toward the \gl galaxy RXJ1131-1231 at $z_{\rm QSO}$\,=\,0.658
were carried out using IRAM \pdbi (PdBI; Program ID: S14BX001; PI: D.
Riechers). Two observing runs were carried out on 2014 December 06 and 2015
February 05 under good weather conditions in the C and D array configurations,
respectively. The 2 mm receivers were used to cover the redshifted \bco line
and the underlying continuum emission, employing a correlator setup providing
an effective bandwidth of 3.6 GHz and a spectral resolution of 10.0 MHz ($\sim$
21.5 \kms). This resulted in 3.75 hours of cumulative six antenna-equivalent on-source
 time after discarding unusable visibility data.
The nearby quasars 1127$-$145 and 1124$-$186 were observed every 22 minutes
for pointing, secondary amplitude, and phase calibration, and 1055$+$018 was
observed as the bandpass calibrator for both tracks.
MWC349 and 3C279 were observed as primary flux calibrators for the C and D
array observations, respectively, yielding $\lesssim$15\% calibration accuracy.

The \ncode{gildas} package was used to reduce and analyze the visibility data
which are then imaged and deconvolved using the CLEAN algorithm with ``natural"
weighting. This yields a synthesized clean beam size of 4$\farcs$44 $\times$ 1\farcs95 (PA = 13\degr).
The final rms noise is $\sigma$\,=\,1.45\,mJy\,\kms
beam\pmOne over 10 MHz (21.5\,\kms). The continuum image at $\nu_{\rm cont}\sim$139\,GHz
is created by averaging over all the 3.16\,GHz line-free channels. This
yields an rms noise of 0.082 mJy\,beam$^{-1}$. % see README.md in 04Sep15

\subsection{CARMA \cco} %DONE
Observations of the \cco rotational line in RXJ1131
($\nu_{\rm rest}$\,=\,345.7959899\,GHz; $\nu_{\rm rest}$\,=\,209.1\,GHz)
were carried out with the \carma (CARMA;
Program ID: cf0098; PI: D. Riechers)
in the D array configuration on 2014 February 02 under poor 1.5\,mm
weather conditions and on 2014 February 17 under good 1.5\,mm
weather conditions. The correlator setup provides a bandwidth of 3.75 GHz in
each sideband and a spectral resolution of 12.5 MHz ($\sim$17.9 \kms). The
line was placed in the lower sideband with the local oscillator tuned to $\nu_{\rm LO}\sim$216 GHz. The radio quasars J1127$-$189 (first track) and 3C273
(second track) were observed
every 15 minutes for pointing, amplitude, and phase calibration. Mars was
observed as the primary absolute flux calibrator and 3C279 was observed as
the bandpass calibrator for both tracks. This results in a total on-source time of 2.94 hours after flagging poor
visibility data.

Given that the phase calibrator used for the first track was faint and was
observed under poor weather conditions and that the phase calibrator used for
the second track was far from our target source, the phase calibration is
subpar, with an rms scatter $\sim$60\degr over $\sim$135\,m.
%BLAH... more like 50%
We thus conservatively estimate
a calibration accuracy of $\sim$45\% based on the flux scale uncertainties,
the gain variations over time, and the phase scatter on the calibrated data. We
therefore treat its line intensity with caution and ensure that any physical interpretation
of this system does not rely on this quantity.

The \ncode{miriad} package was used to calibrate the visibility data which are
then imaged and deconvolved using the CLEAN algorithm with ``natural" weighting. This yields a synthesized clean
beam size of 3\farcs2 $\times$ 1\farcs9 (PA\,=\,8\degr) for the lower sideband
image cube. The final rms noise is $\sigma$ = 13.3 mJy km s$^{-1}$ beam$^{-1}$
over a channel width of 25\,MHz. An rms noise of
$\sigma$\,=\,0.83\,mJy\,beam\pmOne is reached by averaging over the
line-free channels.

\subsection{VLA (Archival)} %DONE
Our analysis also uses archival data of the 5\,GHz
radio continuum obtained with the
Very Large Array (VLA; Program ID: AW741; PI: Wucknitz).
Observations were carried out on 2008 December 29 under excellent weather
conditions in the A array configurations for a total of $\sim$7 hours on-source time. The C$-$band receivers were used with a continuum mode setup,
providing a bandwidth of 50 MHz in each sideband.
The nearby radio quasar 1130$-$149 was observed every 10 minutes for
pointing, amplitude, and phase calibration, 1331$-$305 was observed as the
primary flux calibrator, and 0319$+$415 was observed as the bandpass
calibrator, yielding $\sim$10\% calibration accuracy.
We use \ncode{aips} to calibrate the visibility data which
are then imaged and deconvolved using
the CLEAN algorithm using robust\,=\,0. This yields a synthesized clean
beam size of 0$\farcs$49 $\times$ 0\farcs35 (PA\,=\,0\farcs18) and a final
rms noise of $\sigma$ = 13 $\mu$Jy beam\pmOne.


\section{HST astrometry} \label{sec:HST}
We obtained an {\it HST} image taken with the F555W filter ($V$-band)
using the ACS/Wide Field Camera from the
Hubble Legacy Archive\footnote{Based on observations
made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, and obtained from the Hubble
Legacy Archive, which is a collaboration between the Space Telescope Science
Institute (STScI/NASA), the Space Telescope European Coordinating Facility
(ST-ECF/ESA) and the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre (CADC/NRC/CSA).}
with a goal to understand the origin of the emission detected
in our mm observations. The details of the observations can be found
in \citet[hereafter C06]{Claeskens06a}.
We adopt the VLA 5\,GHz map of
$\sim$0\farcs5 resolution as the
reference coordinate frame to align the optical ($V$-band) image.
We shift the latter to the east by 0\farcs5963 in R.A. and $+$0\farcs8372 in
Dec., which is consistent with the typical astrometric precision (1$^{\prime\prime}-$2$^{\prime\prime}$) of
images from the Hubble Legacy Archive\footnote{http://hla.stsci.edu/hla\_faq.
html}. This astrometric correction is critical to avoid artificial spatial
offsets between different emitting regions and to carry out our lens modeling,
in which the absolute position of the foreground lensing galaxy is guided by its
coordinates in the optical image, where its emission is clearly detected.
The VLA image is calibrated using a well-monitored phase
calibrator, with absolute positional accuracy of $\sim$2 mas.
For this reason, the absolute alignment between the VLA image and other
interferometric images reported in this paper are expected to have an astrometric
precision better than 0\farcs1, modulo uncertainties related to the SNR, phase
instabiliy, and beam size.

\section{Results} \label{sec:results}
\subsection{\bco Emission} \label{sec:CO21} %DONE
We detected the \bco line emission toward the background galaxies
at $\gtrsim$27$\sigma$ significance, confirming the redshift at $z_{\rm CO}$ =
0.65370\,$\pm$\,0.0005. The emission is spatially and dynamically resolved
with a highly asymmetric double-horned line profile
as shown in \Fig{CO21spec}. Fitting a double Gaussian results in peak
flux densities of 75.3\pmm2.6 and 24.0\pmm2.0 mJy, and a FWHM of
179\pmm9 \kms and 255\pmm28 \kms, respectively. The peaks are separated by
$\Delta v_{\rm sep}$ = 400\pmm12\,\kms. The total integrated line flux is 24.1\,$\pm$\,2.3 Jy \kms. % see 15May16/

\Sec{differential} and the magnification factors for various kinematic
components are listed in \Tab{model}.

%   - note that theoretical sigma is lower = 1.5 * sqrt(160-126+1) * 21.5 ~ 0.2 Jy km/s /beam, due to higher noise in some channels with emission
We construct the zeroth moment map and the renzogram in \Fig{CO21mom}, and
the higher-order first and second moment maps in \Fig{CO21highO}
using the $uv$-continuum subtracted data cube over a velocity range of
$\Delta v$ $\sim$ 750\,\kms.
The renzogram is created using different velocity channels for the blue- and
redshifted velocity components and
the higher-order moment maps are created using
channel maps with 3$\sigma$ clipping.
The peak flux density is 8.12\pmm0.30 Jy\,\kms\,beam\pmOne
in the intensity-integrated map.

The deconvolved source size FWHM
is estimated to be 5\farcs1\pmm0\farcs72 $\times$ 3\farcs72\pmm0\farcs66,
and thus, the emission is resolved over $\sim$2.2 beams.
While the lensed emission is not strictly distributed as two-dimensional
Gaussian;
the fit recovers the line intensity enclosed by the emitting
region, we therefore take this as an estimate on the extent of the lensed
emission. On the other hand, if we assume the spatial distribution of
the lensed molecular gas emission is similar to that in the optical to \nir
wavelengths, the lensed emission would be more accurately described by an
annulus, enclosing the partially complete ``Einstein Ring'' and
the lensed knots (see \Fig{CO21mom}).

The contours start at 3$\sigma$ and increment at steps of
$\pm$3$\sigma$, where $\sigma$\,=\,0.3 mJy beam\pmOne. The crosses denote the
location of the foreground galaxy at $z$\,=\,0.295.

\label{fig:CO21highO}}
\end{figure}

We also place an upper limit on \rot[HNC]{2}{1} line emission
in the foreground galaxy at $z\sim$0.295.
Assuming a typical line width of 300\,\kms, this corresponds to a 3$\sigma$
limit of 0.35\,mJy\,\kms\,beam\pmOne.

\subsection{\cco Emission}
We detect \cco line emission toward RXJ1131 at {\bf BLAH}$\sigma$ significance.
The spectrum is shown in \Fig{co32spec}, which seems to have a double-peak profile.
This is expected if RXJ1131 is truly a disk galaxy (see previous
sections). The high phase noise in the calibration leads to a low SNR
detection. We thus estimate the line intensity to be
35.7\,$\pm$\,21.9{\bf BLAH} Jy\,\kms by summing up fluxes over the FWZI
linewidth used to infer \bco line intensity ($\sim$700 \kms).

\begin{figure}[!Htbp]
%\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.455\textwidth]{../Figures/coOverlay.eps}
\caption{CARMA \cco line profile (solid) without continuum subtraction is
over-plotted on the continuum-subtracted PdBI \bco line profile (dashed).
The velocity scale is with respect to $z$=0.6537, which corresponds to the
dynamical center of the \bco line. The spectral resolution for \cco and \bco
is 35.8 \kms and 21.5 \kms, respectively.
 \label{fig:co32spec}}
\end{figure}

Assuming the spatial extents between \bco and \cco are similar and therefore
magnified by the same amount, the line intensities
correspond to a brightness temperature ratio of
$r_{\rm 32}$\,=\,T$_{\small \cco}$$/$T$_{\small \bco}$\,=\,0.66\,$\pm$\,0.41.

\subsection{Continuum Emission} %DONE
No 1.5\,mm continuum emission is detected at the position of \cco
down to a 3$\sigma$ limit of 2.49\,mJy beam\pmOne.
This is consistent with the spectrum shown in \Fig{co32spec}.

We detect PdBI 2\,mm continuum in \Fig{cont}. The integrated flux density is
1.2\pmm0.2 mJy, with a peak flux
$S_\nu$\,=\,800\pmm88\,$\mu$Jy\,beam\pmOne
centering on the lensing galaxy. Slightly extended emission is also detected
along the lensed arc. This suggests that the detected emission comes from
both the foreground galaxy and the background galaxy and that the
emission is marginally resolved along its major axis.
We subtract a point source model in $uv$-plane to remove the unresolved
emission toward the foreground galaxy. The peak flux (0.39\,$\pm$\,0.08\,mJy)
in the residual map coincides with the lensed arc, and is consistent with
the difference between the integrated and the peak flux in the
original continuum map ($\sim$0.4 mJy). We therefore adopt
$S_\nu$ = 0.39\pmm0.08 mJy as the 2\,mm continuum emission toward
the background galaxy.

$\sigma_{\rm 5GHz}$\,=\,13 $\mu$Jy beam\pmOne in the left and right panel, respectively.
The central crosses indicate the centroid of the foreground galaxy,
as detected in the optical image. The synthesis beams are shown in the bottom left corner of each panel.
\label{fig:cont}}\vspace{0.51em}
\end{figure}

The VLA C-band continuum image in \Fig{cont} shows resolved emission from the
jets and core of the foreground elliptical galaxy
as well as emission toward the background quasar.
Multiple peaks are seen along the arc and their centroids
coincide with the optical emission from the quasar.
We extract the flux densities for the arc and the core in \Tab{photometry}.
We find a spectral index of $\alpha^{\rm 2mm}_{\rm 6cm}$\,=\,$-$0.024
for the foreground
galaxy and $\alpha^{\rm 2mm}_{\rm 6cm}$\,=\,$-$0.345
for the background galaxy by fitting a
power-law (S$_\nu \propto \nu^{\alpha}$) to the continuum emission at
5\,GHz and 2\,mm.

\subsection{Photometry} \label{sec:photometry} %DONE
We compile \mir (MIR) to \fir broadband photometry from various
catalogs available on the NASA/IPAC Infrared Science
Archive (IRSA) in \Tab{photometry} with aperture corrections
when warranted. These data were obtained from
the Two Micron All Sky Survey \citep[2MASS;][]{Skrutskie06a},
the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer \citep[{\it WISE};][]{Wright10a},
the {\it Infrared Astronomical Satellite}
\citep[{\it IRAS};][]{Neugebauer84a}, and
the Multiband Imaging Photometer \citep[MIPS;][]{Rieke04a} and
Mid-infrared Infrared Array Camera \citep[IRAC;][]{Fazio04a} on
the \spitzer.
We retrieve PBCD (level 2) {\it Spitzer}/IRAC images from the
Spitzer Heritage Archive and perform aperture photometry on
the channel 1 image to extract the flux density at 3.6\,$\mu$m
since it is not available from the IRSA archive.

The emission in the IRAC images is slightly extended. We thus use the
{\it HST} image ($\sim$0\farcs07 resolution) to determine
origins of their centroids, all of which are found to be
centered at the position corresponding to the lensed emission from the
background galaxy. To recover the diffuse background emission, we subtract a
point source model centered on the lensing galaxy, using the average
FWHM found by fitting a Gaussian profile to several field stars
with the \ncode{imexam} routine of IRAF.
We perform aperture photometry on the residual image
to obtain decomposed flux measurements from the background galaxy.
The photometry for the foreground galaxy is then obtained
by subtracting the background emission from the
observed total flux. The resulting photometry in
\Tab{photometry} are obtained after performing an aperture correction
described in the IRAC Instrument Handbook\footnote{http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/SPITZER/docs/irac/iracinstrumenthandbook/} to
correct for the fact that the imaging was calibrated
using a 12" aperture, which is larger than the aperture (5\farcs8) we used to
perform aperture photometry.

We fit a power-law spectrum to the
decomposed IRAC photometry to disentangle the observed total flux
at MIPS 24\,$\micron$ into the foreground and
background galaxies. We find a spectral index of $\alpha\sim-$1.8 and
$\alpha\sim-0.85$ for the lensing galaxy and RXJ1131, respectively.
This is consistent with the mean 3.6\,$-$\,8\,$\micron$
spectral slope of
$\alpha$\,=\,$-$1.07\,$\pm$\,0.53 found for unobscured AGN
\citep{Stern05a}. An extrapolation of the fit to 24$\micron$
yields 33.96\,$\pm$\,0.01\,mJy and 25.19\,$\pm$\,0.03\,mJy
for the foreground galaxy and RXJ1131, respectively.
We note that the IRAC photometry includes
emission from old stellar populations and is prone to
dust extinction. Hence, the decomposed fluxes are only
our best estimate of the warm dust emission.
We incorporate the decomposed 24$\micron$ point in our
SED fitting to provide some constraints on
the Wien tail beyond the dust peak
of the spectral energy distribution (SED) of RXJ1131.
Details of the SED modeling is presented in \Sec{SED}.

Extraction of the {\it Herschel}/SPIRE photometry was
carried out using \ncode{sussextractor} within the Herschel Interactive
Processing Environment \citep[HIPE;][]{Ott10a}
on Level 2 maps obtained from the Herschel Science Archive.
These maps were processed by the SPIRE pipeline
version 13.0 within HIPE. The \ncode{sussextractor} task estimates
the flux density from an image convolved with a kernel
derived from the SPIRE beam. The flux density
measured by \ncode{sussextractor} is additionally confirmed
using the Timeline Fitter, which performs photometry
by fitting a 2D elliptical Gaussian to the Level 1 data at the
source position given by the output of \ncode{sussextractor}. The fluxes
obtained from both methods are consistent within the uncertainties.

\section{Analysis} \label{sec:anal}
%\subsection{Stellar Mass and BH-Bulge Mass Correlation}
%Rest-frame $K$-band (NIR) photometry has been proposed as a reliable proxy to
%the underlying total stellar mass. Using the decomposed IRAC photometry at 3.6$\micron$ (rest-frame $K$-band),
%we find a stellar mass of BLAH, using the BLAH.
%This implies a $M_{\rm BH}$$/$$M^*$ = BLAH (cf. $\sim$0.1\% found in local galaxies).
%
%The AGN-starburst connection has become a central issue with the discovery of the relation
%between stellar velocity dispersion and mass of the central black hole in spheroidal stellar
%systems (Magorrian et al. 1998, Ferrarese & Merritt 2000, Gebhardt et al. 2000). Given that
%elliptical galaxies are mainly old, this relation has to be put in place at their formation history.
%
%This implies that RXJ1131 is in the BLAH stage of the evolution, in which the BH ?.

\subsection{Lens Modeling} \label{sec:lensmodel}
At the angular resolution of the \bco data, the images are resolved over
$\sim$2 resolution elements. Given the extent of the lensed emission,
this implies that our \bco observations do not resolve
structures (e.g. knots and arcs) of the lensed emission
(i.e., sub-optimal for
performing lens modeling). Nevertheless, the high spectral
resolution of this data provides dynamical information on
spatial scales smaller than the beam (see \Fig{CO21highO}).
Hence, with the high SNR, we reconstruct the intrinsic gas
dynamics by carrying out a parametric lens modeling over different
channel slices of the interferometric data using our lensing code
\uvmcmcfit
(\citealt{uvmcmcfit15a}; see \citealt{Bussmann15a} for details of the code).
Models of each slice thus provide the
properties on the intrinsic kinematics. To increase the SNR for modeling, the
slices are obtained by binning five native channels
($\Delta v$\,$\sim$\,21.5\kms) over the full
linewidth of $\sim$750\,\kms in the original data, resulting in seven
independent channels.

The lens mass distribution is modeled using a singular isothermal
ellipsoid (SIE) profile, which is described by five free parameters: the
positional offset in R.A. and Dec. relative to an arbitrary chosen
fixed coordinate in the image, the Einstein Radius, the axial ratio, and the
position angle. We use the VLA radio continuum emission toward
the foreground galaxy to initialize the positional offset. We impose a
uniform prior $\pm$0\farcs05 in both $\Delta$R.A. and $\Delta$Dec.,
motivated by the astrometry uncertainties in the VLA image as well as
the uncertainties provided by previous SIE lens model \citepalias{Claeskens06a}.
We initialize the Einstein Radius based on the model parameters reported by \citetalias{Claeskens06a}
and impose a uniform prior using $\pm$3$\sigma$ of their uncertainties.
The sources are modeled using elliptical Gaussian profiles, which are
parameterized by six free parameters: the positional offset in R.A.
and Dec. relative to the lens, the intrinsic flux density, the effective
radius, the axial ratio, and the position angle. The position of each source
is allowed to vary between $\pm$1\farcs5 (i.e., within the Einstein Radius)
and the effective radius is allowed to vary from 0\farcs01$-$2$^{\prime\prime}$.

Our code uses an Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to sample the
posterior probability distribution function (PDF).
In each model, we require a target acceptance rate of $\sim$0.25$-$0.5
and check for chain convergence by inspecting trace plots
and requiring the samples are beyond at least an autocorrelation time.
We thus employ $\sim$50,000 samples as the initial ``burn-in'' phase
to stabilize the Markov chains (which we then discard) and
use the final $\sim$5,000 steps, sampled by 128 walkers, to identify
the posterior. Here, we
identify the best-fit model and the quoted uncertainties using the
median and the 68\% confidence intervals in the marginal PDFs.
\input{table_medianLens}

We first obtain a preliminary lens model for each channel slice independently,
where their lens parameters are allowed to vary and are initialized according
to the aforementioned way. We obtain the final model
by repeating the modeling over each slice but fixing their lens parameters
to the overall median in the preliminary models,
as listed in \Tab{lens}.
This ensures that all models share the same lens profile.
The magnification factors in \Tab{model} are determined by taking the ratio
between the image plane flux and the source plane flux of each model.

Our model parameters in \Tab{lens}, describing
the mass distribution of the lensing galaxy, are consistent (within the uncertainties)
with that of the SIE model presented by \citetalias{Claeskens06a}. We find a mass of
$M(\theta$\,\,$<$\,\,$\theta_\textrm{E})$\,=\,(7.47\,$\pm$\,0.02)\,$\times$\,10$^{11}$\,\Msun
within the Einstein radius.

\subsubsection{Interpretation of the Source-plane Morphology} \label{sec:caveat}
The reconstructed source locations in \Fig{model} demonstrate
an intrinsic velocity gradient across the source plane, which is
indicative of a kinematically-ordered disk-like galaxy.
Additional support to the disk conjecture
can be found in the double-horned line profile (\Fig{CO21spec})
and the observed (image plane) velocity field (\Fig{CO21highO}). Furthermore,
\citetalias{Claeskens06a} also find that the reconstructed source plane emission in optical-NIR
is best-reproduced using a $n$\,=\,1 Sersic profile.
We thus interpret RXJ1131 to be a disk galaxy.

% the companion
One other interesting result from our lens model is that a better fit is
found for the red-most channel if we add a second source component (see
top left panel in \Fig{model}). This is consistent with previous results
reported by \citet[hereafter B08]{Brewer08a}, who find an optically faint companion
(component F in their paper) $\sim$2.4\,kpc in projection from the AGN host galaxy in $V$-band,
and \citetalias{Claeskens06a}, who find evidence for an interacting galaxy near RXJ1131.
Spatially, the red velocity component of the CO emission
also coincides with this component F. It is therefore evident that we
detect \bco emission in the companion galaxy.
\defcitealias{Brewer08a}{B08}

To quantify the type of merger (major v.s. minor) conventionally with a mass
ratio, we decompose the total line flux into two components:
one from RXJ1131 and the other from its companion.
Since the companion is only detected in the red-most channel, we
use the best-fit flux densities and magnification factors obtained
from the model of this channel to derive the intrinsic gas mass in the companion.
Assuming a brightness temperature ratio of $r_{\rm 21}$\,=\,1 and
a CO luminosity-to-$H_2$ mass conversion factor of
\alphaco\,=\,0.8\,\alphaU, we find
a molecular gas mass of $M_{\rm gas}$\,=\,$($1.92\pmm0.09$)$\,\E{9} \Msun.
%statistical unc. only (i.e. draw from distributions of on mag. factor & intrinsic flux)
For the molecular gas mass in RXJ1131, we derive
its intrinsic line flux over the FWZI linewidth
using the respective magnification
factors listed in \Tab{model}, which to
first order takes into account effect of differential lensing.
This yields $I_{\small \bco}$\,=\,2.93\pmm0.70 Jy\,\kms,
where the uncertainty includes those on
the magnification factors.
Adopting the same brightness temperature ratio and \alphaco\ as
used for the companion, this corresponds to a gas mass of
$M_{\rm gas}$\,=\,$($1.38\pmm0.33$)$\,\E{10} \Msun,
implying a gas mass ratio of $\sim$7:1 between RXJ1131 and its companion.
We thus classify the system to be a {\em ``wet-wet'' minor merger} according to
the classification scheme commonly used in literature.

The spatial resolution of the data in hand
is a few arcsec, which implies that despite the high SNR and spectral
resolution, this data is insufficient to constrain the
intrinsic sizes of the lensed galaxies, and thus the magnification
factors may be under-predicted. % see Bussmann15

\subsubsection{Spatial Extent and Differential Lensing} \label{sec:differential}
In the image plane shown in  \Fig{CO21mom}, the redshifted component is
cospatial with the Einstein Ring seen in the
optical image, with most of its apparent flux originating from the lensed arc
in the southeast, whereas the blue component is predominately coming from
solely the lensed arc. To further illustrate this, we show the
channel maps of 21.5\,\kms width and a spatial spectra map of 1\farcs5 resolution in
\Fig{chanmap} and \Fig{spatialSpec}, respectively. The figures
show that emission
is present to the west, peaking toward the lensing arc (black crosses in
\Fig{chanmap}) in the red wing, and shifts to the east with decreasing velocity
(blue wing).
This is consistent with the source plane positions in our models and
is suggestive of an extended CO emitting region.

\input{table_magFactor}
Similar to previous studies of RXJ1131, where
differential lensing across {\it HST}
$V$-, $I$-, and $H$-band has been detected with a
magnification factor decreasing from 10.9 to 7.8 \citepalias{Claeskens06a},
the highly asymmetric \bco line profile suggests that
differential lensing is also non-negligible for CO,
causing the redshifted emission to be apparently much brighter than the
blueshifted component and the asymmetric line profile.
This can be explained by the difference in magnification factor $(\mu_{\rm L})$ which
varies from 8.7 to 3.1 across the \bco line (\Tab{model}) and also partly due to a contribution from the companion in the redshifted velocity channels.
The variation in $\mu_{\rm L}$ across channels is consistent with the source plane
positions relative to the caustics in \Fig{model}, where the red wing
emission mainly originates near the cusp
of the caustic and the blue wing emission is located beyond the caustics.
In fact, the intrinsic line flux of the redshifted and
blueshifted emission in RXJ1131 (after subtracting a contribution from the companion)
is $I_{\small \bco}$\,=\,1.26\pmm 0.23 Jy\,\kms and 1.25\pmm0.23 Jy\,\kms, respectively,
implying an intrinsically symmetric line profile. This is consistent with the source-plane
velocity gradient in our lens model (\Fig{model} and \Fig{PV}).
% The difference in magnification factors between CO and optical-to-NIR
% may further indicate that the CO emitting region is more extended and/or
% has a spatial offset from the optical-to-NIR emission
% (\ie different positions and alignment relative to the caustics) given
% the lower magnification factor found for CO (median $\mu_{\rm L}$ = 5.5)
% than in NIR, while their spatial extents appear to be similar. But then it could just be because of the low resolution and
% the degeneracy between the intrinsic source size and the magnification factor.

\subsection{\bco Kinematics}
Fitting a four-parameter double-Gaussian that describes two velocity peaks by a single FWHM
to the ``intrinsic" \bco line profile of RXJ1131 (after correcting for lensing using
the magnification factors for various channels and separating the emission from RXJ1131 and its companion),
we find a roughly symmetric double-horned profile with a flux ratio of 1.2\pmm0.4 between the peaks, which
are separated by
$\Delta v_{\rm sep}$ = 387\pmm45\,\kms, and a
FWHM of 220\pmm72\,\kms.
If we instead fit with a single-Gaussian, we find a FWHM of 600\pmm160\,\kms for RXJ1131
and 73\pmm43\,\kms for the companion galaxy.

A clear velocity gradient and a high
velocity dispersion ($\gtrsim$400\,\kms) near the central region
is seen in \Fig{CO21highO}. While beam smearing is inevitably the
dominant factor in the observed velocity dispersion
at the spatial resolution of this data, the exceedingly
high velocity dispersion may hint
at potential perturbations from the AGN, or internal turbulence due to
interactions with the companion, and/or instability due to the large gas
content.
Therefore, in this scenario, RXJ1131 is
likely a disrupted disk galaxy hosting an optically
bright quasar and is in the process of merging.

\subsection{\bco Dynamical Modeling} \label{sec:dynamics} %DONE
Assuming the velocities of the respective channels used in the
lens modeling correspond to solely the tangential component of the
true velocity vector of a rotating disk (i.e., along the major axis),
we extract a one dimensional PV diagram in \Fig{PV}
by slicing across their source plane positions (PA: 121\degr).

We then attempt to characterize the molecular gas kinematics using an
empirically-motivated disk model \citep[\eg][]{Courteau97a,Puech08a,Miller11a}:
\begin{equation}
V = V_0 + \frac{2}{\pi} V_{a} \arctan(\frac{R}{R_{t}}),
\end{equation}
where $V$ is the observed velocity, $V_0$ is the velocity at dynamical center,
$V_{a}$ is the asymptotic velocity, and $R_{t}$ is the ``turnover''
radius at which the rotation curve becomes flat.
We perform non-linear least square fitting using an orthogonal distance
regression to find the best-fit parameters,
taking into account the uncertainties in both velocity (channel width) and
distance offset. We also place an upper limit on $R_{t}$\,$<$15 kpc
to keep this parameter physical \citep[\eg][]{Puech08a,Miller11a}.
The parameter uncertainties are inferred based on Monte Carlo simulation
of 500 iterations, where the input parameters are perturbed
according to random Gaussian distributions of sigmas
corresponding to their uncertainties.
Using this model, we find $V_{a}$\,=\,975\,$\pm$\,387 \kms,
$R_{t}$\,=\,10.7\,$\pm$\,5.7\,kpc, and $V_0$\,=\,28\,$\pm$\,40 \kms.
However, since emission is not resolved along the flat regime
of the rotation curve, the asymptotic velocity is poorly constrained and
the ``turnover'' radius is at most a lower limit.
In particular, $V_{a}$ and $R_{t}$ are highly correlated with a
Pearson coefficient $R$\,=\,0.998, and 0.027 between $V_{a}$ and $V_0$.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

\caption{Top: Source-plane positions from best-fit \bco lens models are indicated with their associated uncertainties atop

\end{figure}

The asymptotic velocity ($V_{a}$) -- an extrapolation of the model
out to radius beyond the disk scale-length and half-light radius --
is not equivalent to maximum observed velocity ($V_{\rm max}$),
which is commonly used in literature to parameterize disk rotation.
The arctangent model is most commonly used in studies of the
Tully-Fisher relation, where an extrapolation to V$_{2.2}$ (velocity
at 2.2 disk scale-length or $\sim$1.375 half-light radius,
or $\sim$0.7$R_{\rm opt}$\footnote{Radius enclosing 83\% of the light
distribution.}) is typically adopted
as the rotation velocity ($V_{\rm max}$ in their
terminology) since this corresponds to the radius at which the velocity
of a pure exponential disk peaks \citep{Courteau97b}.
We here adopt the maximum {\em observed} velocity
$V_{\rm rot}$\,=\,345\,$\pm$\,55\,\kms at 6\,$\pm$\,3\,kpc from the % line center velo of the reddest channel slice, unc = slice width
dynamical center as a proxy to the rotation velocity.
This radius corresponds to $\sim$0.6$R_e$, where $R_e$ is the half-light
radius $\sim$10.3\,kpc inferred from the {\it HST} $I$-band
lens model (\citetalias{Claeskens06a}; converted to
our cosmology).
We note that the source plane half-light radius varies substantially with
wavelength. In particular, the half-light radius is found to be
$\sim$\,4\,kpc and $\sim$7\,kpc in $V$-band
\citepalias{Brewer08a} and $H$-band \citepalias{Claeskens06a}, respectively.
The CO gas is thus of similar spatial
extents as in $H$ and $I$-bands.

In the rest-frame,
emission in the observed $H$-band corresponds to NIR emission,
tracing radiation from the accretion disk surrounding
the central AGN and also from old and evolved stellar populations;
$I$-band corresponds to roughly the optical $V$-band, tracing stellar radiation from
existing, less massive (\ie longer-lasting) stars;
$V$-band corresponds to roughly $U$-band,  tracing radiation from massive young stars
in the host galaxy. Hence,
the $V$-band compactness may be explained in part
due to the fact that its emission is
more susceptible to dust extinction than in other bands and/or
a central starburst caused by higher
concentrations of star-forming gas towards the central regions -- owing to
gravitational perturbations induced
from interactions with the companion
\citep[\eg][]{DiMatteo05a}.
This is consistent with the picture that old stars form first and constitute the bulge component
of a spiral galaxy and that nuclear starbursts (in the inner few kpc) can be triggered latter in mergers.

\subsection{SED Modeling} \label{sec:SED}  % DONE
We fit dust SED models to the
24\,\micron$-$2.2\,mm photometry in \Fig{SED}, where we also
include the IRAS 60\,$\micron$ and 100\,$\micron$ upper limits
to constrain the dust peak.
The fit is performed with the code
\ncode{mbb\_emcee} \citep[\eg][]{Riechers13a,Dowell14a}, which samples the posterior
using an MCMC approach and uses instrumental
response curves to perform color correction on-the-fly.
The SED model consists of a modified-blackbody
function with a power-law attached to the
Wien side to account for an excess in the MIR owing to warm,
small dust emission.
% Previous studies find that in the absence of mid-IR data, a powerlaw slope
% of $\alpha$ = 2 is consistent with SB and slightly more shallow, $\sim$1.5, % for SB/AGN composite systems (Blain et al., 2003; Casey, 2012; Koss et al., 2013).
%
%We add $\sim$15\% calibration uncertainties in quadrature to obtain the total
%uncertainties for the PdBI continuum in our fitting procedure.
The model is thus described by five free parameters: the rest-frame characteristic dust
temperature (T$_{d}$), the emissivity index ($\beta$), the power-law index
($\alpha$), the flux normalization at 500\,$\micron$ ($f_{\rm norm}$), and
the observed-frame wavelength at which the emission
becomes optically thick ($\lambda_{0}$). We impose
an upper limit of 100\,K on $T_d$ \citep[see \eg][]{Sajina12a},
a Gaussian prior centered around
$\mu$\,=\,1.9 with $\sigma$\,=\,0.3 on $\beta$, and an upper limit of
1000\,$\micron$ on $\lambda_0$.
We check for chain convergence by requiring the autocorrelation
length of each parameter to be less than the number of steps
taken for the burn-in phase (which are then discarded).
Here we report the statistical means % modes in log file
% summary statistics (global mode (where min. chi),
% marginal mode (in log file), posterior median (instead of posterior means;
% need to compute)
and the 1$\sigma$ confidence interval in the marginal PDFs
as the best-fit parameters, as listed in \Tab{SED}.

\input{table_mbb}

In the first model, we include the 24\,$\micron$ data
to constrain the power-law index. Based on the
best-fit of this model, we find a
\fir luminosity (rest-frame 42.5\,$-$\,122.5\,$\micron$) of
3.81\petm{2.04}{1.92}\E{12}\,\Lsun and a
dust mass of 22\petm{5}{18}\E{8}\,\Msun, uncorrected for lensing.
For the mass absorption coefficient, we adopt
$\kappa$\,=\,2.64\,m$^2$kg\pmOne at 125.0\,$\micron$
(rest frame; \citealt{Dunne03a}).
The dust mass uncertainty does not
include those in the absorption coefficient.

A fit including the MIR 24\,$\micron$ photometry
is likely an upper limit on the \fir luminosity arising from the starburst
in the AGN host galaxy.
% since the fit include contribution from the AGN (through power-law to MIR)
If we instead fit for a model excluding the 24\,$\micron$ constraint,
two major consequences are immediately apparent.
First, the power-law index is poorly-constrained (see \Tab{SED}).
Second, the steep power-law implies a small contribution
from the power-law regime
to the total IR luminosity as compared to the graybody.
Thus, the \fir luminosity in
this model should, in principle, correspond to a
lower limit on the cold dust emission.
Using the best-fit parameters
for this model, we find a total IR luminosity
\LIR (rest-frame 8\,$-$\,1000\,\micron) of 9.71\petm{6.14}{-6.05}\E{12}\,\Lsun,
a \fir luminosity \LFIR of 4.72\petm{2.54}{2.26}\E{12}\,\Lsun and a
dust mass $M_{\rm dust}$ of 11\petm{5}{6}\E{8}\,\Msun, uncorrected for lensing.
Taken at face value, this implies a FIR-to-IR luminosity ratio
of $\sim$58\pmm35\%.

The dust temperature from both models is similar to that of
ULIRGs at 0.6\,$<$\,$z$\,$<$\,1.0 (54\,$\pm$\,5\,K;
\citealt[hereafter C13]{Combes13a}).
We note the \fir luminosity is comparable in both models, which is
not surprising given the lack of constraints in the MIR.
For the subsequent analysis, we adopt the physical quantities
from the first model (\ie with constraints at 24\,\micron).
The choice of SED model does not affect
the derived star formation rate (SFR) given the similar \fir luminosity.
Yet, the dust mass is higher in the former but consistent within the
uncertainties.
We correct for lensing using the median magnification
factor $(\mu_{\rm L}\eq5.5)$
from the CO lens models. This yields a
 \LFIR of $($6.9\pmm3.6$)$\E{11}\,\Lsun
 and
 a total IR luminosity of $\sim$1.5\E{12}\,\Lsun,  implying RXJ1131 is a ULIRG.
Assuming a Salpeter initial
mass function \citep{Salpeter55a}, we find a
SFR$_{\rm FIR}$ of 120\pmm63\,\sfrU using the
standard conversion \citep{Kennicutt98a}.

\subsection{ISM Properties} \label{sec:properties}
In this section, we derive the gas properties of the merger system
based on \bco and compare with those reported by
C13, which is the largest sample of
IR-luminous galaxy at similar redshift
(0.6\,$<$\,$z$\,$<$\,1.0) with CO measurements\footnote{The
\fir luminosity in C13 is derived based on 60\,$\micron$ and 100\,$\micron$ IRAS fluxes,
and using a different definition of
\LFIR: rest-frame 40\,$-$\,500\,\micron. Following this convention,
we find a \fir luminosity of
\LFIR = $($8.8\pmm0.4$)$\E{11}$(\mu_{\rm L}$/5.5$)\pmOne$\,\Lsun and
a SFR of $($150\pmm70$)$\,\sfrU.}.
% the SFR of RXJ1131 is lower (cf. SFR\,$>$\,200 \Msun yr\pmOne, with an average of 1200 in C13).
We note that their results are based on \bco and \rot{4}{3} line observations with the
IRAM 30-m single-dish telescope.

\subsubsection{Linewidth and Sizes} \label{sec:sizes}
A linewidth of $\Delta v_{\rm FWHM}$$\sim$600\pmm160\,\kms found from
fitting a single Gaussian
is considerably larger that those in the \citepalias{Combes13a} sample
(370\,\kms) as well as local ULIRGs
\citep[300\pmm85\,\kms, with the largest being 480\,\kms;][hereafter S97]{Solomon97a}.
%ULIRGs (z < 0.3) studied in CO(1-0) by Solomon97a: ≥ 1/3 of them have double-peaked or flat-topped spectrum. But their linewidths are based on single Gauss fit.
Yet, given the dynamic nature of these galaxies,
a CO linewidth of $\sim$600 may not be surprising.
Indeed, a linewidth of $\Delta v$ = 750\,\kms has been observed
in a local LIRG (Arp 118) \citep{SV05a}.
Such FWHM is also commonly observed in high-$z$ starburst galaxies
\citep[780\pmm320\,\kms; \eg][]{Greve05a}.
\defcitealias{Solomon97a}{S97}\defcitealias{Greve05a}{G05}\defcitealias{SV05a}{SV05}

The CO gas in RXJ1131 is $\sim$6\pmm3\,kpc in radius (in the source plane),
which is more
extended than the sample of disk-like U/LIRGs studied by
\citet[hereafter U14]{Ueda14a}, who find an average radius of 3.5\pmm2.3\,kpc but with a range of 1.1\,$-$\,9.3\,kpc.
Such a range is consistent with the results reported by \citet{Gao99a}, where
they also find CO disks extending out to $R\sim$10\,kpc.
In contrast to the results
reported in the classical study by
\citet[hereafter DS98]{Downes98a}, who find molecular gas sizes of $R<$1\,kpc in their sample of local ULIRGs
(see also \citealt{Bryant99a} and \citealt{Iono09a}), it appears that the molecular gas in ULIRGs
can be distributed over large regions comparable to
those reported in high-$z$ ($z$$>$\,1) galaxies \citep[$R\sim$7\,kpc;
\citetalias{Greve05a};][]{Daddi10a, Riechers11a, Ivison11a}.
While we cannot draw any conclusions on the evolution of 
molecular gas size
as we are only studying one
ULIRG at intermediate redshift, it appears that local ULIRGs are composed of
mergers at various stages of merging, and are therefore not
necessarily more compact than
high-$z$ SMGs \citep[cf. \eg][]{Iono09a}.

% SFRSD:
We do not attempt to derive a SFR surface density and gas surface density
since we do not have any constraints on the dust continuum size
and the fact that
the gas surface density is unlikely to be constant across the CO region
given the centrally concentrated $V$-band emission, which we interpret as
merger-induced starburst (see \Sec{caveat}).
Should we decide to do this, it would imply
a series of assumptions to be made, leading to surface densities that are not
meaningful in any case.

\subsubsection{Dynamical Mass}
Assuming the gas is virialized,
the dynamical mass can be approximate as
$M_{\rm dyn} = \sigma^2 R / G$,
where $\sigma$ is the velocity dispersion, or the rotational velocity in the case of a rotating disk model
$($\ie $\sigma$ = $V_{\rm rot}\, \sin\, i)$.
Using a rotational velocity $V_{\rm rot} \, \sin\, i$\,=\,345\,\kms (see \Sec{dynamics}),  % uncorrected for inclination
we find a dynamical mass of
$M_{\rm dyn}$\,$\sin^2 i$\,$(<$\,6\,kpc$)$ = 17\E{10}\,\Msun enclosed
within the CO-emitting region in RXJ1131.
If we instead consider the
\bco line peak separation $(\Delta v_{\rm sep}/2 \sim$200\,\kms$)$ as the rotation velocity, we find
$M_{\rm dyn}$\,$\sin^2 i$\,$(<$\,6\,kpc$)$ = 5.8\E{10}\,\Msun.
We correct for the inclination effect using the
morphological axial ratio ($a/b\sim$1\farcs8 / 3\farcs25)
from the reconstructed image (Figure 3 in \citetalias{Claeskens06a}), yielding
an inclination angle of 56.4\degr, which is consistent with the
observed unobscured AGN and an observable double peak line profile.
The dynamical mass is then
8.3\E{10}\Msun\,$<$\,$M_{\rm dyn}$\,$<$\,25\E{10}\Msun.
Our estimate should be considered at best an upper limit since
the gas is unlikely to be virialized in RXJ1131.
% based on the observed velocity dispersion and the presence of a closeby companion.
For the following sections, we use the
lower limit (8.3\pmm1.9)\E{10}\,\Msun as the dynamical mass as it is
derived in a manner similar to commonly used in literature (\eg \citetalias{Solomon97a,Downes98a,Greve05a}).

Using the velocity dispersion obtained with a single Gaussian fit to the
line profile of the companion ($\sigma$ = 30\,\kms)
and its intrinsic source size of $\sim$700\,pc obtained from the {\em HST}
$V$-band lens model \citepalias{Brewer08a},
we find a dynamical mass of $M_{\rm dyn}$\,$\sin^2 i$ = 5\E{6}\,\Msun.
This corresponds to $M_{\rm dyn}$\,=\,2\E{7}\,\Msun if we assume an
inclination angle of 30$\degr$.
We note that this is substantially lower than its gas mass, which is a more reliable estimate based on
the data in hand.
We adopt the $V$-band size as the radius $R$ owing to the fact that
it is the only size estimate available for the companion.
We do not use this dynamical mass for deriving any additional physical parameters, and thus it
does not alter our interpretations of the system throughout this paper.

%%% using disk model, should use FWHM of single Gauss fit then (Fu+13)
%Using $M_{\rm dyn}$\,$\sin^2 i$ = 4\E{4}\,$v_{\rm FWHM}^2\,R$
% \citep{Neri03a}, which assumes a disk geometry,  and our estimate of $V_{\rm rot}$ as
%$v_{\rm FWHM}$, we find a dynamical mass of
%$M_{\rm dyn}$\,$\sin^2 i$\,$(<$\,6\,kpc$)$ = 3\E{10}\,\Msun enclosed
%within the CO-emitting region.
%If we instead consider the

%the morphological axial ratio ($a/b\sim$1\farcs8 / 3\farcs25)

%The dynamical mass is then

%% the systematic uncertainty on the inclination angle may cause this estimate to differ by
%% a factor of $\sim$2.
%Our estimate is likely a lower limit given the presence of a companion. In a merger model,
%the dynamical mass would be a factor of $\sim$2 higher \citep[and references therein]{Neri03a}.

% The dynamical mass in RXJ1131 is thus higher than local ULIRGs
% ($M_{\rm dyn}(R\leq)0.6\,kpc)$\,$\sim$\,6\E{9}\,\Msun; \citepalias{Downes98a}).


\subsubsection{Gas Mass and Gas Ratios}

% SV05: Solomon+97: average Mgas ~7e9 Msun
% SV05: high-z: (2.5-10)e10 Msun
A total molecular gas mass of
$M_{\rm gas}^{\rm total}$ = $($1.57\pmm0.38$)$\E{10}\,\Msun is
residing within the merger system (see \Sec{caveat}).
This is comparable to those found in the
\citetalias{Combes13a} sample %(1.5\E{10}\Msun)
as well as local U/LIRGs
\citep[][\citetalias{Solomon97a}]{Sanders96a} but higher than
in local LIRGs \citepalias{Ueda14a}, as expected.
Our finding is thus consistent with previous results, where
high-$z$ galaxies tend to have higher molecular gas mass %\footnote{Assuming the same conversion factor}
and is
distributed over larger spatial extents
\citepalias[\eg][]{SV05a,Riechers11a,Ivison11a}.
% gas-to-dyn ratio
% DS98: f ~ 0.16 (but w/in disc or ring of R ~ 0.5 kpc)
% Bothwell+13: f ~ 0.3? (but over larger R)
% --> ULIRGs gas fraction is even lower if average over same scale as SMGs
% Daddi10a; Tacconi10a: f_gas ? 40% in z ? 1 discs, significantly higher than local discs (but alphaCO not same as ULIRGs)
Using the dynamical mass and the total
gas mass ($M_{\rm gas}^{\rm total}$), we find a gas mass
fraction of $f_{\rm gas-dyn}$ = 0.19\pmm0.37, which is
consistent with the results reported by \citetalias{Combes13a}:
a gas fraction of 15\% in ULIRGs at 0.2\,$<$\,$z$\,$<$\,0.4 and 24\%
in those at 0.6\,$<$\,$z$\,$<$\,1.0, and those from resolved measurements of local ULIRGs \citepalias{Downes98a}.
% This implies that the gas fraction in ULIRGs at $z$$<$\,1 is
% similar to high-z starburst galaxies, but
% lower if we average over the same spatial scales (as SMGs, which
% are more extended; \citet{Bothwell13a}).
This implies that the gas fraction in ULIRGs at $z$\,$<$\,1 is
similar to those in high-$z$ ``normal'' star-forming disk galaxies
\citep[assuming an \alphaco conversion factor of 0.8 \alphaU;][]{Daddi10a,Tacconi10a} as well as
high-$z$ starburst galaxies

Using the lensing-corrected dust mass,
% of $M_{\rm dust}$ = 4.0\petm{0.9}{3.3}\E{8}$(\mu_{\rm L}/5.5)\pmOne$\,\Msun,
we find a gas-to-dust ratio of
40\pmm34, which is significantly lower than the statistical average
of $f_{\rm gas-dust}$\,=\,206
in the \citetalias{Combes13a} sample but
consistent with their range of values and the
\citet[][]{Wilson08a}
sample of local ULIRGs. %$($50$-$70$)$.
% If we assume that most ULIRGs at the same epoch should have similar dust and
% gas content owing to their empirical scaling relations
% with the parameters in the fundamental metallicity relation \citep{Mannucci10a}
% and their respective evolutions as well as the
% well-established \LFIR--\Lp correlation \citep[\eg][]{Young91a, Sanders91a},
% the low gas-to-dust ratio of RXJ1131 compared to the
% \citetalias{Combes13a} sample may be explained
% in part due to differential lensing between the gas and the dust, leading to
% an overestimation of the dust mass via our adoption of the CO magnification
% factor, but this is
% unlikely [the dominant reason/enough to account] for the factor of $\sim$5
% discrepancy. It is thus necessary to invoke other possible explanations.
We note that the gas-to-dust ratio maybe biased low as
the optically thick gas is likely to be more extended than the dust, leading to
an overall lower magnification factor than the dust emission,
and thus an overestimate of the
dust mass via our adoption of the CO magnification factor.

% A direct comparison to the literature is not straightforward as the dust mass estimate
% is highly dependent on the method, \eg the model assumed, the wavelength and resolution at which the data 
% were observed. Seaquist+04 find that a GDR can be 
% affected by a factor of $\sim$5 in the inner few kpc in some cases for
% U/LIRGs but global GDR may be unaffected. If we assume that the dust mass
% obtained from the literature is obtained through the most appropriate
% way with the given data for their sample, then the main uncertainty related to the dust mass is the mass
% opacity coefficient. While the main systematic uncertainties associated with the gas mass
% are the \alphaco conversion factor and the brightness temperature ratio $R_{\rm 21}$.

There are a number of systematic uncertainties associated with this quantity, \eg
the mass opacity coefficient $\kappa$,
the \alphaco conversion factor, and the brightness temperature ratio $R_{\rm 21}$.
The fact that RXJ1131 has a lower dust-to-gas ratio 
and appears to be more dusty than most ULIRGs at the same epoch
may imply different physical
environment compared to others. If we instead use the ``Galactic" \alphaco value, 
the gas mass (and thus gas-to-dust ratio) would be $\sim$6 times higher.
On the other hand, we would also obtain a higher gas mass if 
we assume subthermal excitation between \bco and \aco line emission.
However, we expect this to be a minor effect as ULIRGs are observed to be
thermalized up to $J$ = 3 or 4.

\subsubsection{SFE and Depletion Timescales}
% CO-IR luminosity correlation
% SFE:
% in terms of LFIR/Mgas:
% Greve+05: 450 +/- 170 Lsun/Msun for SMG
% Solomon97a: 180 +/- 160 Lsun/Msun
% SV05: local (z<0.1 spirals) of SFE < 100

% in terms of LFIR/L'CO:
% Greve+05: SMG 360 +/- 140 Lsun (K km/s pc^2)^-1
% Solomon97a: LFIR/L'CO = 160

% SFE > 100 for ULIRGs and SMGs, 0.1 < z < 3 Downes, Solomon & Radford93, Tacconi, L. J., Genzel, R., Smail, I., et al. 2008, ApJ, 680, 246, Riechers, D. A., Carilli, C. L., Maddalena, R. J., et al. 2011a, ApJL, 739, L31.

To first order, the star formation efficiency
$($SFE = \LFIR$/$$M_{\rm gas})$
indicates the \SF rate per
unit solar mass of molecular gas available in a galaxy.
Using a wavelength range of 40\,$-$\,500\,$\micron$ defined
in \citetalias{Combes13a} as the far-IR luminosity,
we find an SFE of 58\pmm10 \Lsun $M_{\odot}^{-1}$,
which is on the low end among other U/LIRGs
% \citep[$\sim$180\pmm160 \Lsun $M_{\odot}^{-1}$;][]{Solomon97a, Combes11a}
\citep{Solomon97a, Combes11a}
but 
similar to those of
low-$z$ spiral galaxies \citepalias[$z$\,$<$\,0.1;][]{SV05a}.
In constrast, a star formation efficiency of $>$100 \Lsun $M_{\odot}^{-1}$
has been reported in ULIRGs and SMGs at 0.6\,$<$\,$z$\,$<$\,3
\citep[][\citetalias{Riechers11a,Combes13a}]{Tacconi08a}.
\defcitealias{Tacconi08a}{T08}
% Depletion time:
% Greve+05: ~40 Myr
Assuming the \SF continues at the current rate without gas replenishment and is the only
way to consume the gas reservoir, this corresponds to a depletion
time of $\tau$\,=\,102\pmm25\,Myr.
Since the \SF rate is expected to vary in an interacting system and that AGN accretion
also consumes some fraction of the gas, the depletion
timescale should only be considered as an upper limit.

The SFE (using the above definition) is highly dependent on the gas mass.
Yet, the use of an ``ULIRG" \alphaco value is not well justified and 
should only be considered as a lower limit \citepalias[see][]{Solomon97a}.
It may be more appropriate to use an \alphaco closer to the ``Galactic" value in 
some ULIRGs \citep[\eg][]{Papadopoulos12a}. 
From numerical models, it is found that mergers on average have lower \alphaco values than
disk galaxies \citep{Narayanan12a}.
But since the gas temperatures and velocity dispersions in minor mergers do not deviate from 
galactic GMCs as much as in major mergers, the \alphaco may not be as extreme as 0.8\,\alphaU.
% thus the rise in CO intensity is not as large, and the X-factor (and thus alphaco) does not decrease as much {Narayana11a}.
Hence,
we can derive an upper limit on the gas mass for RXJ1131 
using the Galactic value of 4.6\,\alphaU. This yields
a gas mass (and thus a SFE) that is $\sim$6 times higher.  
In contrast to results in the classical study of nearby ULIRGs by \citetalias{Downes98a}, who find that
the gas mass exceeds the dynamical mass using 
the Galactic conversion factor 
(and thus inappropriate for their sample), the gas mass derived for
RXJ1131 using the Galactic value is consistent with its dynamical mass.
%Obviously, this will lead to a longer depletion time.

Alternatively, the relatively low SFE maybe intrinsic to RXJ1131.
In that case,  RXJ1131 may evolve into a disk galaxy with a small bulge component
in the context of theoretical simulations by \citet{Hopkins09a}, who suggest 
that the disk component in a gas-rich progenitor galaxy can survive post-merging
by lowering the \SF efficiency (and thus less efficient at removing the angular momentum of
the gas), thereby enabling a higher gas fraction to be retained and 
distributed over a larger extent.
%since there is little/no significant stellar material % (collisionless)
%available to torque away the cold gas in the disc, thus little/no angular momentum is lost, 
%and gas will rapidly reform a cold disc in the background 
%of the relaxing stellar potential.
% --> suppress the formation of a bulge in mergers of gas-rich discs (even in major merger)
% the final product will have a low bulge mass fraction.
%
%i.e. small bulge disc can also form from minor merger or major merger (if gas fraction is sufficiently large).
% 1:1 gas-riich mergers can yield disc-dominated remnants, and 1:3-1:4 ratio major mergers can yield B/T < 0.2.
 
%While the \alphaco conversion factor is commonly assumed to be 0.8\,\alphaU for
%for ULIRGs/starbursts, its numerical value depends on the ISM environment
% \citep[\eg][]{Narayanan11a}.
% For instance, it could be different in a 
% dynamically turbulent galaxy, where the gas is warmer, more excited, 
% and denser, than in a quiescent galaxy.
% In addition, the physical basis for deriving the gas mass from the CO luminosity is
% by assuming the ISM only consists of virialized, non-overlapping gas clouds, 
% which is often not true in ULIRGs \citep[][\citetalias{Solomon97, Downes98a}]{Downes93a}.
% % the CO emitting gas in the centers of ULIRGs is unlikely to be virialized, but instead bound by the potential of the galaxy or from molecular gas in pressure equilibrium rather than gravitational equilibrium.

% % DS98: lower alphaCO for objects with extended surface gas densities, where gas temperature and velocity dispersion are higher; Mgas derived from radiative transfer model instead of using standard conversion factor, which yields the \alphaco = 0.8 UNIT for local ULIRGs. 
% % Also see Scoville+97

 %As discussed in Solomon \& Vanden
 %Bout (2005), low-$z$ studies of ULIRGs have led to the
 %suggestion that the conversion factor could be several times
 %smaller (Downes et al. 1993; Bryant \& Scoville 1999, DS98). This can
 %arise in ULIRGs if the gas is concentrated in the nuclear
 %regions (as a result of dissipative galaxy merging) and the
 %molecular emission linewidths can be broadened by the galactic
 %dynamics associated with the stellar mass, not just the self-gravitating
 %gas mass as in individual GMCs in which the
 %standard conversion factor was derived. In addition, the mean
 %gas temperature and density may be different in the ULIRG
 %nuclei as a result of the intense star formation activity and since AlphaCO
 %should vary as density and temperature e.g. (Dickman et al. 1986).
 % Also should be a continuous distribution instead of a bimodal value (Narayanan+12).
 % Yet, from numerical models, it is found that mergers have lower alphaCO than
 % disk galaxies, thus we can derive an upper limit on the gas mass in the RXJ1131 merger system using a disk alphaCO factor.
% In a minor merger, the rise in gas temperatures and velocity dispersions are not as extreme as in major mergers. Hence, the rise in velocity-integrated CO intensity is not as large, and the X-factor (and thus alphaco) does not decrease as much {Narayana11a}.

%\subsubsection{Comparison with High-$z$ SMGs and BzKs}
%At high redshifts ($z$\,$\gtrsim$\,1), SMGs are the irregular, turbulent
%star-bursting galaxies with elevated specific \SF rates (CITE) %\citep[sSFR][]{}
%and BzKs are the ``normal" star-forming disk galaxies with relatively lower 
%\SF efficiencies, \SF rates and also
%longer depletion times \citep[\citetalias{Daddi10a};][]{CW13}.

%In fact, an \alphaco conversion factor of 3.6\pmm0.8 
%has been proposed for BzKs using kinematic analysis/dynamical model (based on the dynamical mass; e.g. Daddi10a). 
% Whereas \citet{Tacconi08a, Carilli10a} place an upper limit of $\sim$0.8 on high-$z$ SMGs, leading the emergence of two star formation modes. Carilli+10: based on dynamical constraints

\section{Discussion} \label{sec:diss}
\subsection{Velocity Offset and a Recoiling Black Hole}
Using the redshift deduced from the CO line 
as the systemic redshift, we find
a velocity offset of $\sim$780\,\kms with the optical lines:
the broad Mg{\scriptsize II}~2798\AA\ and the narrow 
$[$O{\scriptsize III}$]$~4959, 5007\AA\ lines \citepalias[$z_{\rm AGN} = 0.658$;][]{Sluse03a}.
This indicates that the broad line region (BLR) of the AGN is at a
slightly higher redshift than the host galaxy.
From the CO renzogram and channel maps in \Fig{CO21mom} and \Fig{chanmap}, the emission 
corresponding to the the line center are not co-spatial
with the optical quasar. In particular, the quasar emission forms 
the point-like images along the lensing arc, which is 
spatially offset to the NW
of the CO line center emission.
Spatial offsets between optical BLRs and CO emission are not uncommon
but such a high kinematic offset is not commonly observed.
For instance, the
velocity offset between AGNs and their hosts galaxies in 
an SDSS sample of ongoing mergers at $z$\,$<$\,0.21 is at most $\sim$410\,km/s \citep{Comerford14a}.
The same authors also suggest mechanisms
such as AGN outflows, jets, and gravitational recoil of SMBHs in post-merger
as plausible explanations for these offsets.

AGN outflows or starburst-driven winds have been observed
in \eg SMMJ1636+4057 \citep[][]{Swinbank05a}, but 
no evidence for outflows are found in RXJ1131 in the existing data. 
% an explanation due to the in/outflows arising from radiation pressure or AGN winds.
Alternatively, it can be an indication of the BH(s) orbiting the a common center in
the host galaxy.
In principle, this would only be valid if the velocity offset between the BLR and 
the narrow line of the gas in the host galaxy is consistent with its orbital velocity. 
%(\ie carrying along its accretion disc and BLR)
Since \citetalias{Sluse03a} only report a redshift combining the broad and narrow lines, 
% \ie it is unclear what's the velocity offset between MgII and [OIII]
the lack of a redshift from solely the BLR of the AGN precludes us from interpreting this as the favoured
explanation for the velocity offset.

In fact, a large velocity offset can also result from a recoiling black hole (BH) where its
BLR is moving at high velocity relative to the bulk of the host galaxy and
the ionized gas \citep{Madau04a, Bonning07a, Loeb07a}. % narrow AGN lines.
Such a scenario may occur after galaxies and their BHs merge, during which 
their orbital energy is being released as gravitational wave to overcome the last stable orbit.
This results in a recoil in the merged BH for an uneven BH mass merger as a
non-zero net angular momentum is also being carried away.
Depending on their initial conditions, % mass ratios, spin, rotational direction, 
numerical relativity simulations have shown that
the recoil velocity can reach up to $\sim$4000\,\kms for spinning BHs \citep[\eg][]{Campanelli07a}.
% The BH is displaced from the galactic nucleus in this scenario, and might 
% return to the center in a few dynamical time-scales 
% by dynamical friction or be kicked out of the gravitational potential of the host galaxy.
This together with the fact that the BH in RXJ1131 has a high spin parameter \citep{Reis14a} 
renders the recoiling BH scenario a viable option for the origin
of the optical velocity offset.
To reconcile this picture with the fact that a companion is still observed, 
the system may be in its subsequent stages of (minor) merging but was initially
a major merger. 
This would imply previous encounters between RXJ1131 and its companion, 
which would also explain the spinning BH.

It is worth noting that
while these large velocity offsets are theoretically achievable,
they are not commonly observed --- only a few objects have been reported with optical offsets $\gtrsim$1000\,\kms.  
For instance,
the most promising candidate of a recoiling BH with both spectroscopy and imaging
signatures is CID-42 at $z$\,=\,0.359, which has 
a velocity offset of $\sim$1300\,\kms between the narrow and broad component of H$\beta$ \citep{Civano10a}. 
% which has a similar velocity offset
% of $\sim$1300\,\kms between the narrow and broad component of H$\beta$ 
% in two optical component separated by $\sim$ 2.5 kpc within the same galaxy \citep{Civano10a}. 
Other examples include 
the type-1 QSO SDSS 0956+5127 at $z$\,$\sim$\,0.714, with an offset of 1200\,\kms
between Mg{\scriptsize II}~2798\AA\ and $[$O{\scriptsize III}$]$~4959, 5007\AA\ lines 
\citep{Steinhardt12a}, 
and
SDSSJ0927+2943 at $z$\,$\sim$\,0.713, with an offset of 2650\,\kms \citep{Komossa08a}.
% shows an exceptional optical emission-line spectrum with two
% sets of emission lines: one set of very narrow emission lines, and a second set of broad Balmer and
% broad high-ionization forbidden lines which are blueshifted by 2650 \kms
% relative to the set of narrow emission lines \citep{Komossa08a}.

\subsection{Merger stage RXJ1131-1231}
%It is clear that the signature of a galaxy merger changes as the merging progresses.
%For instance, extended molecular disks are often associated with advanced mergers 
%\citep[\citetalias{Downes98a};][]{Gao99a}.but see also U14 for outliers
% with extended molecular gas in merger remnants

The (gas) mass ratio, the intrinsic CO line profile,  
% since the bulk of the angular momentum can be retained only in minor mergers if small separation
and the source-plane velocity field are all evident of 
a minor merger, in good agreement with an 
earlier study by \citetalias{Brewer08a} who
independently conclude the presence of a dwarf companion 
of size $\sim$700\,kpc across. Since minor mergers may in some cases
result from previous passage of major mergers, it is possible that RXJ1131
has encountered with the progenitor galaxy of the companion and is undergoing 
the subsequent series of minor merging.
One piece of evidence comes from % that they have encountered
the compact UV emission, which can be starburst resulting from gas accumulation 
owing to a non-axisymmetric perturbation from the companion.
% the stellar component torques away the angular momentum, allowing the gas to fall inward.
The highly spinning black hole in RXJ1131 is also consistent with 
this hypothesis. 
If we favor the gravitational wave recoil mechanism 
to explain the optical velocity offset, it would also imply the black 
holes (and their host galaxies) have merged or are at their final coalescence. 
In addition, the source-plane CO position of the companion appears to be consistent with 
a picture where its molecular gas is mixed with RXJ1131 (but with large uncertainties). 
%\ie companion CO location along/within the RXJ1131 CO disc
% as well as one where its emission is co-spatial with the stellar light. 
The IR luminosity also agrees with 
the results from previous studies: AGNs are
typically found in late stage mergers 
\citep{Yuan10a,Iwasawa11a,Carpineti12a} and
only major mergers near their final
coalescence can provide \LIR$>$\,10$^{12}$\,\Lsun,
\citep[\eg][]{Carpineti15a,Larson16a}.

It may be puzzling as to why the stellar emission in the companion 
is spatially offset from RXJ1131 while its CO gas appears to be mixed-in if they 
have encountered.
This phenomenon is in fact not unique to our source. 
The gas cores of the individual 
% merging galaxies 
mergers NGC~6090 and NGC~6240 are also observed
to be coalescing  
% is in the process of or has already coalesced into a single component
while their stellar cores remain
separated \citep[0.5$-$3\,kpc;][]{Bryant99a}. 
Although this is difficult to reconcile with the fact that the stellar light in the companion 
originates from recent \SF (UV emission). 
More sensitive and higher resolution observations will be needed
to confirm any offsets between the CO gas and the stellar light in the companion.
% allow for a more detailed lens modeling to trace the gas distribution and morphology in the system
Another puzzle may be the absence of morphological features.
One straightforward explanation may simply be the lack of spatial resolution.
Alternatively, it may be a result of the offset in timing between observable
morphological disturbances and the merger-induced starbursts \citep{Lotz08a}.
% with strong morphological disturbances occurring before bursts of merger-induced star formation and for shorter durations 

\subsection{Fate of RXJ1131}
The classical picture for mergers is one where they are responsible for the formation of the local 
red and passive spheroidal galaxies.
With more realistic treatments of star formation and feedbacks in recent simulations,
% ? which suppress efficient early star formation ? play a critical role in enabling disc formation in simulations.
it has been suggested that it is possible  to suppress bulge formation 
in gas-rich mergers, thereby evolving into large 
disks \citep{Springel05a, Robertson06a, Hopkins09a}.
% (bulge dominated; Springel05a, Robertson06a)
% and disc with low B/D ratio ($\sim$0.1$-$0.2; Hopkins09a).
%
%In systems that are sufficiently gas-rich, it is possible to 
%suppress the formation of a bulge in mergers of gas-rich discs (even in major merger)
%since there is little/no significant stellar material % (collisionless)
%available to torque away the cold gas in the disc, thus little/no angular momentum is lost, 
%and gas will rapidly reform a cold disc in the background 
%of the relaxing stellar potential.
%Gas, being collisional, cannot violently relax, but must
%have its angular momentum torqued away in order to dissipate and
%build a bulge by forming stars in a central starburst 
%(\ie gas loses angular momentum to stars in the
%perturbed disk and fall toward center).
% In a merger,
%this torque is primarily internal, from stars in the same disc: the
%passages and merger of the secondary induce a non-axisymmetric
%distortion in the primary stellar and gas disc. The stellar distortion
%(in a trailing resonance and close proximity to the gas response)
%efficiently removes angular momentum from the gas and allows it
%to fall to the center and form a bulge  (see also Barnes \& Hernquist
% 1996).
% A bulge will form because cold gas with no angular momentum 
% will be largely unable to form any sort of disk, and that a galaxy?s 
% worth of gas compressed to high densities and small
% radii will inevitably form a large mass in stars). 
%
Since both RXJ1131 and its companion are gas-rich
% unlikely RXJ1131 will evolve into present-day massive 
% ellipticals (M$\gtrsim$1\E{12}\,\Msun), 
% gas-poor mergers: --> present-day massive elliticals
% (Boylan-Kolchin, Ma & Quataert 2005, 2006; Naab, Khochfar & Burkert 2006; Robertson B., Cox T. J., Hernquist L., Franx M., Hopkins P., Martini P., Springel V., 2006a, ApJ, 641, 21; Cox et al. 2006b)
and that the bulk of the angular momentum of the gas is  
retained in minor mergers,
it is likely that RXJ1131 will evolve into either a 
``normal'' elliptical/S0 galaxy or a large disk galaxy.  
% normal E only because gE needs ways to remove angular momentum efficiently for gas to funnel
In the latter, the stellar populations from the companion will be displaced onto the 
dominant galaxy to thicken the disk \citep[\eg][]{Lotz08a, Robertson06a}.
% disk from gas-rich major merger: \citep[\eg][]{Lotz08a, Robertson06a}.
Given that the molecular gas in 
RXJ1131 is distributed in an extended disk configuration and that its 
SFE is on the low end among other ULIRGs,  % not enough stellar material to efficiently remove ang. mom.
it is more conceivable that RXJ1131 will evolve into the
latter.
% Lotz08a: a major gas-rich merger without AGN feedback does not, by itself, produce a red and dead spheroidal galaxy
Other mechanisms e.g. formation of bar-like structures will be needed to remove the
angular momentum of the gas more efficiently to transform the gas disk into a stellar spheroid and
AGN feedbacks are also necessary to halt further activities for RXJ1131 to evolve into an 
E/S0 galaxy \citep{Lotz08a}.

by observing its \bco and \cco line emission, which are the
two lowest rotational transitions of CO observable with current instruments.

Our results confirm the presence of a gas-rich companion, consistent with previous studies.

We find that RXJ1131 is likely a massive disturbed gas-rich disk galaxy with extreme IR
luminosity, in the process of merging 
we conclude that RXJ1131 is s a wet-wet minor merger 
between a ULIRG and an optically faint companion.

% % any further work needed to resolve the remaining problems
The intrinsically symmetric double-horned line profile, the smooth and 
symmetric velocity field/gradient seen in both the source plane from our lens model as well 
as in the image plane, and C06 model $n$=1 Sersic profile all suggest
a kinematically-order rotating disk galaxy.
Additional
characteristics such as peak velocity dispersion at the central region and a
``spider'' diagram are needed to confirm the disk morphology.

The high dispersion near the dynamical center also
suggest that RXJ1131 is turbulent, albeit lack of spatial resolution. Overall
implies RXJ1131 is a minor merger of a turbulent disc, but higher-resolution
data are needed to confirm this.

% Gas fraction and SFH
While there is an emerging consensus on
the correlation between molecular gas content and redshift,
suggesting it as the explanation for the elevated SFR at high redshift/
the observed trend in the cosmic SFH,
we find that the gas fraction in RXJ1131 is consistent with both ULIRGs at
 0.2\,$<$\,$z$\,$<$\,0.4
and 0.6\,$<$\,$z$\,$<$\,1.0. Thus, we find no evidence of 
evolution in gas fraction.

The compactness of the emission in $V$-band (rest-frame UV)
suggests that the \SF in RXJ1131 is proceeding in a
compact region embedded within a large reservoir of molecular gas, 
which may be explained by gas inflow toward nuclear regions due to
perturbations in the disk from the companion.
Such a scenario may support the results in recent models: mergers/ULIRGs evolve into massive disks.

% consistent with the picture that BLAH, while it is also possible that BLAH.
%Our results indicate a self-consistent picture of ... followed by gravitationally instability and SF in a massive, gas-rich disk and a subsequent build-up of a central bulge through inflow triggered by disk installbilities and/or minor merger.

%Elliptical/S0 galaxies
%S0:  exhibit a bulge and disk similar to spiral galaxies, but do not show any signs of spiral arms or significant quantities of interstellar material. They consist primarily of old, population II stars and for this reason, are often misclassified as elliptical galaxies when viewed face-on.
%The origins of S0 galaxies are still unknown, but one idea is that they were originally spiral galaxies which either lost or used up their interstellar medium through interactions with another galaxy.
