\section{Introduction}

In this paper, we explore the ISM properties of the quadruply imaged
quasar RXS J113151.62-123158 (hereafter RXJ1131) at
$z_\textrm{AGN}$\,$=$\,0.685, with an Einstein ring of size
1\farcs83 in radius. The foreground lensing
galaxy is an elliptical galaxy at $z_\textrm{L}$\,$=$\,0.295. The redshifts
are spectroscopically confirmed by \citet{Sluse03a}.
A black hole mass estimate of M$_{\rm BH}$\,$<$\,2\E{8}\Msun
is also reported based on X-ray observations \citep{Reis14a}.

This paper is structured as follows.
In \Sec{obs} and \Sec{HST}, we outline the details of the observations and data reduction process.
In \Sec{results}, we report the measurements of the CO lines and photometry from optical to radio wavelengths.
In \Sec{anal}, we represent our dynamical lens modeling on the \bco data and the physical properties inferred for  RXJ1131.
In \Sec{diss}, we discuss the results and implications of this study in the context of molecular gas evolution in mergers and massive galaxies.
Finally, we summarize the main results of this study and present our conclusions in \Sec{sum}.
We use a concordance $\Lambda$CDM cosmology throughout this paper, with
parameters from the WMAP9 results:
$H_0$ = 69.32 \kms Mpc\pmOne, $\Omega_{\rm M}$ = 0.29, and
$\Omega_{\Lambda}$ = 0.71 \citep{Hinshaw13a}.
% same as LR16a: i.e. use last column (WMAP+eCMB+BAO+H0) of Tab 4 in Hinshaw+13 because that's what astropy use for WMAP9 as cosmo

\section{Observations} \label{sec:obs}
\subsection{PdBI \bco} % DONE
Observations of the \bco rotational line
($\nu_{\rm rest}$\,=\,230.5379938 GHz; $\nu_{\rm obs}$\,=\,139.4\,GHz)
toward the \gl galaxy RXJ1131-1231 at $z_{\rm QSO}$\,=\,0.658
were carried out using IRAM \pdbi (PdBI; Program ID: S14BX001; PI: D.
Riechers). Two observing runs were carried out on 2014 December 06 and 2015
February 05 under good weather conditions in the C and D array configurations,
respectively. The 2 mm receivers were used to cover the redshifted \bco line
and the underlying continuum emission, employing a correlator setup providing
an effective bandwidth of 3.6 GHz and a spectral resolution of 10.0 MHz ($\sim$
21.5 \kms). This resulted in 3.75 hours of cumulative six antenna-equivalent on-source
 time after discarding unusable visibility data.
The nearby quasars 1127$-$145 and 1124$-$186 were observed every 22 minutes
for pointing, secondary amplitude, and phase calibration, and 1055$+$018 was
observed as the bandpass calibrator for both tracks.
MWC349 and 3C279 were observed as primary flux calibrators for the C and D
array observations, respectively, yielding $\lesssim$15\% calibration accuracy.

The \ncode{gildas} package was used to reduce and analyze the visibility data
which are then imaged and deconvolved using the CLEAN algorithm with ``natural"
weighting. This yields a synthesized clean beam size of 4$\farcs$44 $\times$ 1\farcs95 (PA = 13\degr).
The final rms noise is $\sigma$\,=\,1.45\,mJy\,\kms
beam\pmOne over 10 MHz (21.5\,\kms). The continuum image at $\nu_{\rm cont}\sim$139\,GHz
is created by averaging over all the 3.16\,GHz line-free channels. This
yields an rms noise of 0.082 mJy\,beam$^{-1}$. % see README.md in 04Sep15

\subsection{CARMA \cco} %DONE
Observations of the \cco rotational line in RXJ1131
($\nu_{\rm rest}$\,=\,345.7959899\,GHz; $\nu_{\rm rest}$\,=\,209.1\,GHz)
were carried out with the \carma (CARMA;
Program ID: cf0098; PI: D. Riechers)
in the D array configuration on 2014 February 02 under poor 1.5\,mm
weather conditions and on 2014 February 17 under good 1.5\,mm
weather conditions. The correlator setup provides a bandwidth of 3.75 GHz in
each sideband and a spectral resolution of 12.5 MHz ($\sim$17.9 \kms). The
line was placed in the lower sideband with the local oscillator tuned to $\nu_{\rm LO}\sim$216 GHz. The radio quasars J1127$-$189 (first track) and 3C273
(second track) were observed
every 15 minutes for pointing, amplitude, and phase calibration. Mars was
observed as the primary absolute flux calibrator and 3C279 was observed as
the bandpass calibrator for both tracks. This results in a total on-source time of 2.94 hours after flagging poor
visibility data.

Given that the phase calibrator used for the first track was faint and was
observed under poor weather conditions and that the phase calibrator used for
the second track was far from our target source, the phase calibration is
subpar, with an rms scatter $\sim$60\degr over $\sim$135\,m.
%BLAH... more like 50%
We thus conservatively estimate
a calibration accuracy of $\sim$45\% based on the flux scale uncertainties,
the gain variations over time, and the phase scatter on the calibrated data. We
therefore treat its line intensity with caution and ensure that any physical interpretation
of this system does not rely on this quantity.

The \ncode{miriad} package was used to calibrate the visibility data which are
then imaged and deconvolved using the CLEAN algorithm with ``natural" weighting. This yields a synthesized clean
beam size of 3\farcs2 $\times$ 1\farcs9 (PA\,=\,8\degr) for the lower sideband
image cube. The final rms noise is $\sigma$ = 13.3 mJy km s$^{-1}$ beam$^{-1}$
over a channel width of 25\,MHz. An rms noise of
$\sigma$\,=\,0.83\,mJy\,beam\pmOne is reached by averaging over the
line-free channels.

\subsection{VLA (Archival)} %DONE
Our analysis also uses archival data of the 5\,GHz
radio continuum obtained with the
Very Large Array (VLA; Program ID: AW741; PI: Wucknitz).
Observations were carried out on 2008 December 29 under excellent weather
conditions in the A array configurations for a total of $\sim$7 hours on-source time. The C$-$band receivers were used with a continuum mode setup,
providing a bandwidth of 50 MHz in each sideband.
The nearby radio quasar 1130$-$149 was observed every 10 minutes for
pointing, amplitude, and phase calibration, 1331$-$305 was observed as the
primary flux calibrator, and 0319$+$415 was observed as the bandpass
calibrator, yielding $\sim$10\% calibration accuracy.
We use \ncode{aips} to calibrate the visibility data which
are then imaged and deconvolved using
the CLEAN algorithm using robust\,=\,0. This yields a synthesized clean
beam size of 0$\farcs$49 $\times$ 0\farcs35 (PA\,=\,0\farcs18) and a final
rms noise of $\sigma$ = 13 $\mu$Jy beam\pmOne.


\section{HST astrometry} \label{sec:HST}
We obtained an {\it HST} image taken with the F555W filter ($V$-band)
using the ACS/Wide Field Camera from the
Hubble Legacy Archive\footnote{Based on observations
made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, and obtained from the Hubble
Legacy Archive, which is a collaboration between the Space Telescope Science
Institute (STScI/NASA), the Space Telescope European Coordinating Facility
(ST-ECF/ESA) and the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre (CADC/NRC/CSA).}
with a goal to understand the origin of the emission detected
in our mm observations. The details of the observations can be found
in C06. We adopt the VLA 5\,GHz map of
$\sim$0\farcs5 resolution as the
reference coordinate frame to align the optical ($V$-band) image.
We shift the latter to the east by 0\farcs5963 in R.A. and $+$0\farcs8372 in
Dec., which is consistent with the typical astrometric precision (1$^{\prime\prime}-$2$^{\prime\prime}$) of
images from the Hubble Legacy Archive\footnote{http://hla.stsci.edu/hla\_faq.
html}. This astrometric correction is critical to avoid artificial spatial
offsets between different emitting regions and to carry out our lens modeling,
in which the absolute position of the foreground lensing galaxy is guided by its
coordinates in the optical image, where its emission is clearly detected.
The VLA image is calibrated using a well-monitored phase
calibrator, with absolute positional accuracy of $\sim$2 mas.
For this reason, the absolute alignment between the VLA image and other
interferometric images reported in this paper are expected to have astrometric
precision better than 0\farcs1, modulo uncertainties related to the SNR, phase
errors, and beam size.

\section{Results} \label{sec:results}
\subsection{\bco Emission} \label{sec:CO21} %DONE
We detected the \bco line emission toward the background galaxies
at $\gtrsim$27$\sigma$ significance, confirming the redshift at $z_{\rm CO}$ =
0.65370\,$\pm$\,0.0005. The emission is spatially and dynamically resolved
with a highly asymmetric double-horned line profile
as shown in \Fig{CO21spec}. Fitting a double Gaussian results in peak
flux densities of 75.3\pmm2.6 and 24.0\pmm2.0 mJy, and a FWHM of
179\pmm9 \kms and 255\pmm28 \kms, respectively. The peaks are separated by
$\Delta v_{\rm sep}$ = 400\pmm12\,\kms. The total integrated line flux is 24.1\,$\pm$\,2.3 Jy \kms. % see 15May16/

A detailed discussion of this effect is presented in
\Sec{differential} and the magnification factors for various kinematic
components are listed in \Tab{model}.

%   - note that theoretical sigma is lower = 1.5 * sqrt(160-126+1) * 21.5 ~ 0.2 Jy km/s /beam, due to higher noise in some channels with emission
We construct the zeroth moment map (\Fig{CO21mom}) and
the higher-order first and second moment maps (\Fig{CO21highO})
using the $uv$-continuum subtracted data cube over a velocity range of
$\Delta v$ $\sim$ 750\,\kms. The higher-order moment maps are created using
channel maps with 3$\sigma$ clipping.
The peak flux density is 8.12\pmm0.30 Jy\,\kms\,beam\pmOne
in the intensity-integrated map. The deconvolved source size FWHM
is estimated to be 5\farcs1\pmm0\farcs72 $\times$ 3\farcs72\pmm0\farcs66,
and thus, the emission is resolved over $\sim$2.2 beams.
While the lensed emission is not strictly distributed as two-dimensional
Gaussian;
the fit recovers the line intensity enclosed by the emitting
region, we therefore take this as an estimate on the extent of the lensed
emission. On the other hand, if we assume the spatial distribution of
the lensed molecular gas emission is similar to that in the optical to \nir
wavelengths, the lensed emission would be more accurately described by an
annulus, enclosing the partially complete ``Einstein Ring'' and
the lensed knots (see \Fig{CO21mom}).

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

\caption{Left: an overlay of the velocity-integrated \bco emission on the {\it HST} $V$--band (F555W)
image. Right: contours are color-coded to represent the red and blue wings of the emission.
The contours start at 3$\sigma$ and increment at steps of
$\pm$3$\sigma$, where $\sigma$\,=\,0.3 mJy beam\pmOne. The crosses denote the
location of the foreground galaxy at $z$\,=\,0.295.
\label{fig:CO21mom}}
\end{figure}

We also place an upper limit on \rot[HNC]{2}{1} line emission
in the foreground galaxy at $z\sim$0.295.
Assuming a typical line width of 300\,\kms, this corresponds to a 3$\sigma$
limit of 0.35\,mJy\,\kms\,beam\pmOne.

\subsection{\cco Emission}
We detect \cco line emission toward RXJ1131 at {\bf BLAH}$\sigma$ significance.
The spectrum is shown in \Fig{co32spec}, which seems to have a double-peak profile.
This is expected if RXJ1131 is truly a disk galaxy (see previous
sections). The high phase noise in the calibration leads to a low SNR
detection. We thus estimate the line intensity to be
35.7\,$\pm$\,21.9 Jy\,\kms by summing up fluxes over the FWZI
linewidth used to infer \bco line intensity ($\sim$700 \kms).

\begin{figure}[!Htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.455\textwidth]{../Figures/coOverlay.eps}
\caption{CARMA \cco line profile (solid) without continuum subtraction is
over-plotted on the continuum-subtracted PdBI \bco line profile (dashed).
The velocity scale is with respect to $z$=0.6537, which corresponds to the
dynamical center of the \bco line. The spectral resolution for \cco and \bco
is 35.8 \kms and 21.5 \kms, respectively.
 \label{fig:co32spec}}
\end{figure}

Assuming the spatial extents between \bco and \cco are similar and therefore
magnified by the same amount, the line intensities
correspond to a brightness temperature ratio of
$r_{\rm 32}$\,=\,T$_{\small \cco}$$/$T$_{\small \bco}$\,=\,0.66\,$\pm$\,0.41.

\subsection{Continuum Emission} %DONE
No 1.5\,mm continuum emission is detected at the position of \cco
down to a 3$\sigma$ limit of 2.49\,mJy beam\pmOne.
This is consistent with the spectrum shown in \Fig{co32spec}.

We detect PdBI 2\,mm continuum in \Fig{cont}. The integrated flux density is
1.2\pmm0.2 mJy, with a peak flux
$S_\nu$\,=\,800\pmm88\,$\mu$Jy\,beam\pmOne
centering on the lensing galaxy. Slightly extended emission is also detected
along the lensed arc. This suggests that the detected emission comes from
both the foreground galaxy and the background galaxy and that the
emission is marginally resolved along its major axis.
We subtract a point source model in $uv$-plane to remove the unresolved
emission toward the foreground galaxy. The peak flux (0.39\,$\pm$\,0.08\,mJy)
in the residual map coincides with the lensed arc, and is consistent with
the difference between the integrated and the peak flux in the
original continuum map ($\sim$0.4 mJy). We therefore adopt
$S_\nu$ = 0.39\pmm0.08 mJy as the 2\,mm continuum emission toward
the background galaxy.

$\pm$3$\sigma$, where $\sigma_{\rm 2mm}$\,=\,0.082 mJy beam\pmOne and
$\sigma_{\rm 5GHz}$\,=\,13 $\mu$Jy beam\pmOne in the left and right panel, respectively.
The central crosses indicate the centroid of the foreground galaxy,
as detected in the optical image. The synthesis beams are shown in the bottom left corner of each panel.
\label{fig:cont}}\vspace{0.51em}
\end{figure}

The VLA C-band continuum image in \Fig{cont} shows resolved emission from the
jets and core of the foreground elliptical galaxy
as well as emission toward the background quasar.
Multiple peaks are seen along the arc and their centroids
coincide with the optical emission from the quasar.
We extract the flux densities for the arc and the core in \Tab{photometry}.
We find a spectral index of $\alpha^{\rm 2mm}_{\rm 6cm}$\,=\,$-$0.024
for the foreground
galaxy and $\alpha^{\rm 2mm}_{\rm 6cm}$\,=\,$-$0.345
for the background galaxy by fitting a
power-law (S$_\nu \propto \nu^{\alpha}$) to the continuum emission at
5\,GHz and 2\,mm.

\subsection{Photometry} \label{sec:photometry} %DONE
We compile \mir (MIR) to \fir broadband photometry from various
catalogs available on the NASA/IPAC Infrared Science
Archive (IRSA) in \Tab{photometry} with aperture corrections
when warranted. These data were obtained from
the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS; \citealt{Skrutskie06a}),
the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer ({\it WISE}; \citealt{Wright10a}),
the {\it Infrared Astronomical Satellite}
({\it IRAS};\citealt{Neugebauer84a}), and
the Multiband Imaging Photometer (MIPS; \citealt{Rieke04a}) and
Mid-infrared Infrared Array Camera (IRAC; \citealt{Fazio04a}) on
the \spitzer.
We retrieve PBCD (level 2) {\it Spitzer}/IRAC images from the
Spitzer Heritage Archive and perform aperture photometry on
the channel 1 image to extract the flux density at 3.6\,$\mu$m
since it is not available from the IRSA archive.

The emission in the IRAC images is slightly extended. We thus use the
{\it HST} image ($\sim$0\farcs07 resolution) to determine
origins of their centroids, all of which are found to be
centered at the position corresponding to the lensed emission from the
background galaxy. To recover the diffuse background emission, we subtract a
point source model centered on the lensing galaxy, using the average
FWHM found by fitting a Gaussian profile to several field stars
with the \ncode{imexam} routine of IRAF.
We perform aperture photometry on the residual image
to obtain decomposed flux measurements from the background galaxy.
The photometry for the foreground galaxy is then obtained
by subtracting the background emission from the
observed total flux. The resulting photometry in
\Tab{photometry} are obtained after performing an aperture correction
described in the IRAC Instrument Handbook\footnote{http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/SPITZER/docs/irac/iracinstrumenthandbook/} to
correct for the fact that the imaging was calibrated
using a 12" aperture, which is larger than the aperture (5\farcs8) we used to
perform aperture photometry.

We fit a power-law spectrum to the
decomposed IRAC photometry to disentangle the observed total flux
at MIPS 24\,$\micron$ into the foreground and
background galaxies. We find a spectral index of $\alpha\sim-$1.8 and
$\alpha\sim-0.85$ for the lensing galaxy and RXJ1131, respectively.
This is consistent with the mean 3.6\,$-$\,8\,$\micron$
spectral slope of
$\alpha$\,=\,$-$1.07\,$\pm$\,0.53 found for unobscured AGN
\citep{Stern05a}. An extrapolation of the fit to 24$\micron$
yields 33.96\,$\pm$\,0.01\,mJy and 25.19\,$\pm$\,0.03\,mJy
for the foreground galaxy and RXJ1131, respectively.
We note that the IRAC photometry includes
emission from old stellar populations and is prone to
dust extinction. Hence, the decomposed fluxes are only
our best estimate of the warm dust emission.
We incorporate the decomposed 24$\micron$ point in our
SED fitting to provide some constraints on
the Wien tail beyond the dust peak
of the spectral energy distribution (SED) of RXJ1131.
Details of the SED modeling is presented in \Sec{SED}.

Extraction of the {\it Herschel}/SPIRE photometry was
carried out using \ncode{sussextractor} within the Herschel Interactive
Processing Environment (HIPE; \citealt{Ott10a})
on Level 2 maps obtained from the Herschel Science Archive.
These maps were processed by the SPIRE pipeline
version 13.0 within HIPE. The \ncode{sussextractor} task estimates
the flux density from an image convolved with a kernel
derived from the SPIRE beam. The flux density
measured by \ncode{sussextractor} is additionally confirmed
using the Timeline Fitter, which performs photometry
by fitting a 2D elliptical Gaussian to the Level 1 data at the
source position given by the output of \ncode{sussextractor}. The fluxes
obtained from both methods are consistent within the uncertainties.

\section{Analysis} \label{sec:anal}
%\subsection{Stellar Mass and BH-Bulge Mass Correlation}
%Rest-frame $K$-band (NIR) photometry has been proposed as a reliable proxy to
%the underlying total stellar mass. Using the decomposed IRAC photometry at 3.6$\micron$ (rest-frame $K$-band), 
%we find a stellar mass of BLAH, using the BLAH.
%This implies a $M_{\rm BH}$$/$$M^*$ = BLAH (cf. $\sim$0.1\% found in local galaxies).
%
%The AGN-starburst connection has become a central issue with the discovery of the relation
%between stellar velocity dispersion and mass of the central black hole in spheroidal stellar
%systems (Magorrian et al. 1998, Ferrarese & Merritt 2000, Gebhardt et al. 2000). Given that
%elliptical galaxies are mainly old, this relation has to be put in place at their formation history.
%
%This implies that RXJ1131 is in the BLAH stage of the evolution, in which the BH ?.

\subsection{Lens Modeling} \label{sec:lensmodel}
At the angular resolution of the \bco data, the images are resolved over
$\sim$2 resolution elements. Given the extent of the lensed emission,
this implies that our \bco observations do not resolve
structures (e.g. knots and arcs) of the lensed emission
(i.e., sub-optimal for
performing lens modeling). Nevertheless, the high spectral
resolution of this data provides dynamical information on
spatial scales smaller than the beam (see \Fig{CO21highO}).
Hence, with the high SNR, we reconstruct the intrinsic gas
dynamics by carrying out a parametric lens modeling over different
channel slices of the interferometric data using our lensing code
\uvmcmcfit (\citealt{uvmcmcfit15a}; see \citealt{Bussmann15a} for details of
the code). Models of each slice thus provide the
properties on the intrinsic kinematics. To increase the SNR for modeling, the
slices are obtained by binning five native channels
($\Delta v$\,$\sim$\,21.5\kms) over the full
linewidth of $\sim$750\,\kms in the original data, resulting in seven
independent channels.

The lens mass distribution is modeled using a singular isothermal
ellipsoid (SIE) profile, which is described by five free parameters: the
positional offset in R.A. and Dec. relative to an arbitrary chosen
fixed coordinate in the image, the Einstein Radius, the axial ratio, and the
position angle. We use the VLA radio continuum emission toward
the foreground galaxy to initialize the positional offset. We impose a
uniform prior $\pm$0\farcs05 in both $\Delta$R.A. and $\Delta$Dec.,
motivated by the astrometry uncertainties in the VLA image as well as
the uncertainties provided by previous SIE lens model (C06).
We initialize the Einstein Radius based on the model parameters reported by C06
and impose a uniform prior using $\pm$3$\sigma$ of their uncertainties.
The sources are modeled using elliptical Gaussian profiles, which are
parameterized by six free parameters: the positional offset in R.A.
and Dec. relative to the lens, the intrinsic flux density, the effective
radius, the axial ratio, and the position angle. The position of each source
is allowed to vary between $\pm$1\farcs5 (i.e., within the Einstein Radius)
and the effective radius is allowed to vary from 0\farcs01$-$2$^{\prime\prime}$.

Our code uses an Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to sample the
posterior probability distribution function (PDF).
In each model, we require a target acceptance rate of $\sim$0.25$-$0.5
and check for chain convergence by inspecting trace plots
and requiring the samples are beyond at least an autocorrelation time.
We thus employ $\sim$50,000 samples as the initial ``burn-in'' phase
to stabilize the Markov chains (which we then discard) and
use the final $\sim$5,000 steps, sampled by 128 walkers, to identify
the posterior. Here, we
identify the best-fit model and the quoted uncertainties using the
median and the 68\% confidence intervals in the marginal PDFs.
\input{table_medianLens}

We first obtain a preliminary lens model for each channel slice independently,
where their lens parameters are allowed to vary and are initialized according
to the aforementioned way. We obtain the final model
by repeating the modeling over each slice but fixing their lens parameters
to the overall median in the preliminary models,
as listed in \Tab{lens}.
This ensures that all models share the same lens profile.
The magnification factors in \Tab{model} are determined by taking the ratio
between the image plane flux and the source plane flux of each model.

Our model parameters in \Tab{lens}, describing
the mass distribution of the lensing galaxy, are consistent (within the uncertainties)
with that of the SIE model presented by C06. We find a mass of
$M(\theta$\,\,$<$\,\,$\theta_\textrm{E})$\,=\,(7.47\,$\pm$\,0.02)\,$\times$\,10$^{11}$\,\Msun
within the Einstein radius.

\subsubsection{Interpretation of the Source-plane Morphology} \label{sec:caveat}
The reconstructed source locations in \Fig{model} demonstrate
an intrinsic velocity gradient across the source plane, which is
indicative of a kinematically-ordered disk-like galaxy. 
Additional support to the disk conjecture
can be found in the double-horned line profile (\Fig{CO21spec})
and the observed (image plane) velocity field (\Fig{CO21highO}). Furthermore,
C06 also find that the reconstructed source plane emission in optical-NIR
is best-reproduced using a $n$\,=\,1 Sersic profile.
We thus interpret RXJ1131 to be a disk galaxy.

% the companion
One other interesting result from our lens model is that a better fit is
found for the red-most channel if we add a second source component (see
top left panel in \Fig{model}). This is consistent with previous results
reported by \citet{Brewer08a}, who find an optically faint companion
(component F in their paper) $\sim$2.4\,kpc in projection from the AGN host galaxy,
and C06, who find evidence for an interacting galaxy near RXJ1131.
Spatially, the red velocity component of the CO emission
also coincides with this component F. It is therefore evident that we
detect \bco emission in the companion galaxy.

To quantify the type of merger (major v.s. minor) conventionally with a mass
ratio, we decompose the total line flux into two components:
one from RXJ1131 and the other from its companion.
Since the companion is only detected in the red-most channel, we
use the best-fit flux densities and magnification factors obtained
from the model of this channel to derive the intrinsic gas mass in the companion.
Assuming a brightness temperature ratio of $r_{\rm 21}$\,=\,1 and
a CO luminosity-to-$H_2$ mass conversion factor of
\alphaco\,=\,0.8 $($K \kms pc$^2$$)$\pmOne, we find 
a molecular gas mass of $M_{\rm gas}$\,=\,$($1.92\pmm0.09$)$\,\E{9} \Msun. 
%statistical unc. only (i.e. draw from distributions of on mag. factor & intrinsic flux)
For the molecular gas mass in RXJ1131, we derive
its intrinsic line flux over the FWZI linewidth
using the respective magnification
factors listed in \Tab{model}, which to
first order takes into account effect of differential lensing.
This yields $I_{\small \bco}$\,=\,2.93\pmm0.70 Jy\,\kms,
where the uncertainty includes those on
the magnification factors.
Adopting the same brightness temperature ratio and \alphaco\ as
used for the companion, this corresponds to a gas mass of
$M_{\rm gas}$\,=\,$($1.38\pmm0.33$)$\,\E{10} \Msun,
implying a gas mass ratio of $\sim$7:1 between RXJ1131 and its companion.
We thus classify the system to be a {\em ``wet-wet'' minor merger} according to
the classification scheme commonly used in literature.

The spatial resolution of the data in hand
is a few arcsec, which implies that despite the high SNR and spectral
resolution, this data is insufficient to constrain the
intrinsic sizes of the lensed galaxies, and thus the magnification
factors may be under-predicted. % see Bussmann15

\subsubsection{Spatial Extent and Differential Lensing} \label{sec:differential}
In the image plane shown in  \Fig{CO21mom}, the redshifted component is 
cospatial with the Einstein Ring seen in the
optical image, with most of its apparent flux originating from the lensed arc
in the southeast, whereas the blue component is predominately coming from
solely the lensed arc. To further illustrate this, we show the
channel maps of 21.5\,\kms width and a spatial spectra map of 1\farcs5 resolution in
\Fig{chanmap} and \Fig{spatialSpec}, respectively. The figures
show that emission
is present to the west, peaking toward the lensing arc (black crosses in
\Fig{chanmap}) in the red wing, and shifts to the east with decreasing velocity
(blue wing).
This is consistent with the source plane positions in our models and 
is suggestive of an extended CO emitting region.

\input{table_magFactor}
Similar to previous studies of RXJ1131, where
differential lensing across {\it HST}
$V$-, $I$-, and $H$-band has been detected with a
magnification factor decreasing from 10.9 to 7.8 (C06),
the highly asymmetric \bco line profile suggests that
differential lensing is also non-negligible for CO,
causing the redshifted emission to be apparently much brighter than the
blueshifted component and the asymmetric line profile.   
This can be explained by the difference in magnification factor $(\mu_{\rm L})$ which
varies from 8.7 to 3.1 across the \bco line (\Tab{model}) and also partly due to a contribution from the companion in the redshifted velocity channels.
The variation in $\mu_{\rm L}$ across channels is consistent with the source plane
positions relative to the caustics in \Fig{model}, where the red wing 
emission mainly originates near the cusp 
of the caustic and the blue wing emission is located beyond the caustics.
In fact, the intrinsic line flux of the redshifted and 
blueshifted emission in RXJ1131 (after subtracting a contribution from the companion)
is $I_{\small \bco}$\,=\,1.26\pmm 0.23 Jy\,\kms and 1.25\pmm0.23 Jy\,\kms, respectively, 
implying an intrinsically symmetric line profile. This is consistent with the source-plane
velocity gradient in our lens model (\Fig{model} and \Fig{PV}). 
% The difference in magnification factors between CO and optical-to-NIR 
% may further indicate that the CO emitting region is more extended and/or 
% has a spatial offset from the optical-to-NIR emission 
% (\ie different positions and alignment relative to the caustics) given 
% the lower magnification factor found for CO (median $\mu_{\rm L}$ = 5.5) 
% than in NIR, while their spatial extents appear to be similar. But then it could just be because of the low resolution and 
% the degeneracy between the intrinsic source size and the magnification factor.

\subsection{\bco Kinematics} 
Fitting a four-parameter double-Gaussian that describes two velocity peaks by a single FWHM
to the ``intrinsic" \bco line profile of RXJ1131 (after correcting for lensing using 
the magnification factors for various channels and separating the emission from RXJ1131 and its companion),
we find a roughly symmetric double-horned profile with a flux ratio of 1.2\pmm0.4 between the peaks, which 
are separated by
$\Delta v_{\rm sep}$ = 387\pmm45\,\kms, and a 
FWHM of 220\pmm72\,\kms. 
If we instead fit with a single-Gaussian, we find a FWHM of 600\pmm160\,\kms for RXJ1131
and 73\pmm43\,\kms for the companion galaxy.

A clear velocity gradient and a high
velocity dispersion ($\gtrsim$400\,\kms) near the central region
is seen in \Fig{CO21highO}. While beam smearing is inevitably the
dominant factor in the observed velocity dispersion
at the spatial resolution of this data, the exceedingly
high velocity dispersion may hint
at potential perturbations from the AGN, or internal turbulence due to
interactions with the companion, and/or instability due to the large gas
content. 
Therefore, in this scenario, RXJ1131 is 
likely a disrupted disk galaxy hosting an optically
bright quasar and is in the process of merging.

\subsection{\bco Dynamical Modeling} \label{sec:dynamics} %DONE
Assuming the velocities of the respective channels used in the
lens modeling correspond to solely the tangential component of the
true velocity vector of a rotating disk (i.e., along the major axis),
we extract a one dimensional PV diagram in \Fig{PV}
by slicing across their source plane positions (PA: 121\degr).

We then attempt to characterize the molecular gas kinematics using an
empirically-motivated disk model \citep[\eg][]{Courteau97a,Puech08a,Miller11a}:
\begin{equation}
V = V_0 + \frac{2}{\pi} V_{a} \arctan(\frac{R}{R_{t}}),
\end{equation}
where $V$ is the observed velocity, $V_0$ is the velocity at dynamical center,
$V_{a}$ is the asymptotic velocity, and $R_{t}$ is the ``turnover''
radius at which the rotation curve becomes flat.
We perform non-linear least square fitting using an orthogonal distance
regression to find the best-fit parameters,
taking into account the uncertainties in both velocity (channel width) and
distance offset. We also place an upper limit on $R_{t}$\,$<$15 kpc
to keep this parameter physical \citep[\eg][]{Puech08a,Miller11a}.
The parameter uncertainties are inferred based on Monte Carlo simulation
of 500 iterations, where the input parameters are perturbed
according to random Gaussian distributions of sigmas
corresponding to their uncertainties.
Using this model, we find $V_{a}$\,=\,975\,$\pm$\,387 \kms,
$R_{t}$\,=\,10.7\,$\pm$\,5.7\,kpc, and $V_0$\,=\,28\,$\pm$\,40 \kms.
However, since emission is not resolved along the flat regime
of the rotation curve, the asymptotic velocity is poorly constrained and
the ``turnover'' radius is at most a lower limit.
In particular, $V_{a}$ and $R_{t}$ are highly correlated with a
Pearson coefficient $R$\,=\,0.998, and 0.027 between $V_{a}$ and $V_0$.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

\caption{Top: Source-plane positions from best-fit \bco lens models are indicated with their associated uncertainties atop

\end{figure}

The asymptotic velocity ($V_{a}$) -- an extrapolation of the model
out to radius beyond the disk scale-length and half-light radius --
is not equivalent to maximum observed velocity ($V_{\rm max}$),
which is commonly used in literature to parameterize disc rotation.
The arctangent model is most commonly used in studies of the
Tully-Fisher relation, where an extrapolation to V$_{2.2}$ (velocity
at 2.2 disc scale-length or $\sim$1.375 half-light radius,
or $\sim$0.7$R_{\rm opt}$\footnote{Radius enclosing 83\% of the light
distribution.}) is typically adopted
as the rotation velocity ($V_{\rm max}$ in their
terminology) since this corresponds to the radius at which the velocity
of a pure exponential disk peaks \citep{Courteau97b}.
We here adopt the maximum {\em observed} velocity
$V_{\rm rot}$\,=\,345\,$\pm$\,55\,\kms at 6\,$\pm$\,3\,kpc from the % line center velo of the reddest channel slice, unc = slice width
dynamical center as a proxy to the rotation velocity.
This radius corresponds to $\sim$0.6$R_e$, where $R_e$ is the half-light
radius $\sim$10.3\,kpc inferred from the {\it HST} $I$-band
lens model (C06; converted to
our cosmology).
We note that the source plane half-light radius varies substantially with
wavelength. In particular, the half-light radius is found to be
$\sim$\,4\,kpc and $\sim$7\,kpc in $V$-band
\citep{Brewer08a} and $H$-band (C06), respectively.
The CO gas is thus of similar spatial
extent as $H$ and $I$-bands. 

In the rest-frame, 
emission in the observed $H$-band corresponds to NIR emission, 
tracing radiation from the accretion disk surrounding
the central AGN and also from old and evolved stellar populations; 
$I$-band corresponds to roughly the optical $V$-band, tracing stellar radiation from
existing, less massive (\ie longer-lasting) stars;
$V$-band corresponds to roughly $U$-band,  tracing radiation from massive young stars 
in the host galaxy. Hence,
the $V$-band compactness may be explained in part
due to the fact that its emission is
more susceptible to dust extinction than in other bands and/or 
a central starburst caused by higher 
concentrations of star-forming gas towards the central regions -- owing to
gravitational perturbations induced
from interactions with the companion
\citep[\eg][]{DiMatteo05a}.
The rest-frame NIR emission is likely to be
dominated by evolved stars since 
the AGN is located at $\sim$0\farcs016 inside the central region % and R_H is 7 kpc
of the host galaxy \citep{Sluse06a}, implying a compact accretion disk. 
This is consistent with the picture that old stars form first and constitute the bulge component  
of a spiral galaxy and that nuclear starbursts (in the inner few kpc) are triggered in mergers.

\subsection{SED Modeling} \label{sec:SED}  % DONE
We fit dust SED models to the
24\,\micron$-$2.2\,mm photometry in \Fig{SED}, where we also
include the IRAS 60\,$\micron$ and 100\,$\micron$ upper limits
to constrain the dust peak.
The fit is performed with the code
\ncode{mbb\_emcee} \citep[\eg][]{Riechers13a,Dowell14a}, which samples the posterior
using an MCMC approach and uses instrumental
response curves to perform color correction on-the-fly.
The SED model consists of a modified-blackbody
function with a power-law attached to the
Wien side to account for an excess in the MIR owing to warm,
small dust emission.
% Previous studies find that in the absence of mid-IR data, a powerlaw slope
% of $\alpha$ = 2 is consistent with SB and slightly more shallow, $\sim$1.5, % for SB/AGN composite systems (Blain et al., 2003; Casey, 2012; Koss et al., 2013).
%
%We add $\sim$15\% calibration uncertainties in quadrature to obtain the total
%uncertainties for the PdBI continuum in our fitting procedure.
The model is thus described by five free parameters: the rest-frame characteristic dust
temperature (T$_{d}$), the emissivity index ($\beta$), the power-law index
($\alpha$), the flux normalization at 500\,$\micron$ ($f_{\rm norm}$), and
the observed-frame wavelength at which the emission
becomes optically thick ($\lambda_{0}$). We impose
an upper limit of 100\,K on $T_d$ \citep[see \eg][]{Sajina12a}, 
a Gaussian prior centered around
$\mu$\,=\,1.9 with $\sigma$\,=\,0.3 on $\beta$, and an upper limit of
1000\,$\micron$ on $\lambda_0$.
We check for chain convergence by requiring the autocorrelation
length of each parameter to be less than the number of steps
taken for the burn-in phase (which are then discarded).
Here we report the statistical means % modes in log file
% summary statistics (global mode (where min. chi),
% marginal mode (in log file), posterior median (instead of posterior means;
% need to compute)
and the 1$\sigma$ confidence interval in the marginal PDFs
as the best-fit parameters, as listed in \Tab{SED}.

\input{table_mbb}

In the first model, we include the 24\,$\micron$ data
to constrain the power-law index. Based on the
best-fit of this model, we find a
\fir luminosity (rest-frame 42.5\,$-$\,122.5\,$\micron$) of
3.81\petm{2.04}{1.92}\E{12}\,\Lsun and a
dust mass of 22\petm{5}{18}\E{8}\,\Msun, uncorrected for lensing.
For the mass absorption coefficient, we adopt
$\kappa$\,=\,2.64\,m$^2$kg\pmOne at 125.0\,$\micron$
(rest frame; \citealt{Dunne03a}).
The dust mass uncertainty does not
include those in the absorption coefficient.

A fit including the MIR 24\,$\micron$ photometry
is likely an upper limit on the \fir luminosity arising from the starburst
in the AGN host galaxy.
% since the fit include contribution from the AGN (through power-law to MIR)
If we instead fit for a model excluding the 24\,$\micron$ constraint,
two major consequences are immediately apparent.
First, the power-law index is poorly-constrained (see \Tab{SED}).
Second, the steep power-law implies a small contribution
from the power-law regime
to the total IR luminosity as compared to the graybody.
Thus, the \fir luminosity in
this model should, in principle, correspond to a
lower limit on the cold dust emission.
Using the best-fit parameters
for this model, we find a total IR luminosity
\LIR (rest-frame 8\,$-$\,1000\,\micron) of 9.71\petm{6.14}{-6.05}\E{12}\,\Lsun,
a \fir luminosity \LFIR of 4.72\petm{2.54}{2.26}\E{12}\,\Lsun and a
dust mass $M_{\rm dust}$ of 11\petm{5}{6}\E{8}\,\Msun, uncorrected for lensing.
Taken at face value, this implies a FIR-to-IR luminosity ratio
of $\sim$58\pmm35\%.
%The best-fit SEDs are shown in \Fig{SED} and the
% resulting parameters are listed in \Tab{SED}.

The dust temperature from both models is similar to that of
ULIRGs at 0.6\,$<$\,$z$\,$<$\,1.0 (54\,$\pm$\,5\,K; \citealt[hereafter C13]{Combes13a}).
We note the \fir luminosity is comparable in both models, which is
not surprising given the lack of constraints in the MIR. 
For the subsequent analysis, we adopt the physical quantities
from the first model (\ie with constraints at 24\,\micron).
The choice of SED model does not affect
the derived star formation rate (SFR) given the similar \fir luminosity.
Yet, the dust mass is higher in the former but consistent within the
uncertainties.
We correct for lensing using the median magnification
factor $(\mu_{\rm L}\eq5.5)$
from the CO lens models. This yields a
 \LFIR of $($6.9\pmm3.6$)$\E{11}\,\Lsun
 and 
 a total IR luminosity of $\sim$1.5\E{12}\,\Lsun,  implying RXJ1131 is a ULIRG.
Assuming a Salpeter initial
mass function \citep{Salpeter55a}, we find a
SFR$_{\rm FIR}$ of (120\pmm63)\,\Msun\,yr\pmOne using the
standard conversion \citep{Kennicutt98a}.

\subsection{ISM Properties} \label{sec:properties}
In this section, we derive the gas properties of the merger system
based on \bco and compare with those reported by
C13, which is the largest sample of
IR-luminous galaxy at similar redshift
(0.6\,$<$\,$z$\,$<$\,1.0) with CO measurements\footnote{The
\fir luminosity in C13 is derived based on 60\,$\micron$ and 100\,$\micron$ IRAS fluxes,
and using a different definition of
\LFIR: rest-frame 40\,$-$\,500\,\micron. Following this convention, 
we find a \fir luminosity of 
\LFIR = $($8.8\pmm0.4$)$\E{11}$(\mu_{\rm L}$/5.5$)\pmOne$\,\Lsun and
a SFR of $($150\pmm 70$)$\,\sfrU.}.
% the SFR of RXJ1131 is lower (cf. SFR\,$>$\,200 \Msun yr\pmOne, with an average of 1200 in C13).
We note that their results are based on \bco and \rot{4}{3} line observations with the 
IRAM 30-m single-dish telescope.
 
 \subsubsection{Dynamical Mass}
 Assuming the \bco gas dynamically BLAH. 
%% assuming virialized gas
Using our $V_{\rm rot}$ estimated from dynamical modeling in \Sec{dynamics}, 
we find a dynamical mass of
$M_{\rm dyn}$\,$\sin^2 i$\,$(<$\,6\,kpc$)$ = 17\E{10}\,\Msun enclosed
within the CO-emitting region in RXJ1131. If we instead consider the
\bco line peak separation $(\Delta v_{\rm sep}/2 \sim$200\,\kms$)$ as the rotation velocity, we find
$M_{\rm dyn}$\,$\sin^2 i$\,$(<$\,6\,kpc$)$ = 5.8\E{10}\,\Msun.
We correct for the inclination effect using the
morphological axial ratio ($a/b\sim$1\farcs8 / 3\farcs25) 
from the reconstructed image (Figure 3 in C06), yielding
an inclination angle of 56.4\degr, which is consistent with the
observed unobscured AGN and an observable double peak line profile.
The dynamical mass is then
8.3\E{10}\Msun\,$<$\,$M_{\rm dyn}$($<$6\,kpc)\,$<$\,25\E{10}\Msun.
Since this quantity is derived under the assumption that the gas is virialized in a  % rotatioally supported
spherical distribution, \ie using 
\begin{equation}
M_{\rm dyn} \sin^2 i = \frac{\Delta v^2 R}{G},
\end{equation}
our estimate is at most an upper limit given the observed velocity dispersion and the
presence of a close companion.
COMPARE with Stellar MASS.

Similarly, we estimate the dynamical mass in the companion under the same assumptions. 
For $\Delta v$, we use the FWHM linewidth obtained by fitting a single Gaussian to the pseudo 
\bco line profile obtained by decomposing its contribution to the total line flux using the magnification factor
found for the model of corresponding velocity channel.
Assuming a source size of $\sim$700 pc inferred from the lens model of {\it HST} $V$-band (B08).
This yields $M_{\rm dyn}$\,$\sin^2 i$ = BLAH \Msun.
If we assume an average inclination angle of $<\sin i>^2$ = BLAH, we find $M_{\rm dyn}$ = BLAH \Msun.

%% using disk model
Using $M_{\rm dyn}$\,$\sin^2 i$ = 4\E{4}\,$v_{\rm FWHM}^2\,R$
 \citep{Neri03a}, which assumes a disk geometry,  and our estimate of $V_{\rm rot}$ as 
$v_{\rm FWHM}$, we find a dynamical mass of
$M_{\rm dyn}$\,$\sin^2 i$\,$(<$\,6\,kpc$)$ = 3\E{10}\,\Msun enclosed
within the CO-emitting region. 
If we instead consider the
\bco line peak separation $(\Delta v_{\rm sep}/2 \sim$200\,\kms$)$ as the rotation velocity, we find
$M_{\rm dyn}$\,$\sin^2 i$\,$(<$\,6\,kpc$)$ = 1\E{10}\,\Msun.
To correct for the inclination effect, we
infer an inclination angle of 56.4$\degr$ using
the morphological axial ratio ($a/b\sim$1\farcs8 / 3\farcs25) 
from the reconstructed image (Figure~3 in C06). This inclination angle 
is consistent with the
observed unobscured AGN and an observable double peak line profile.
The dynamical mass is then
1.4\E{10}\Msun\,$<$\,$M_{\rm dyn}$($<$6\,kpc)\,$<$\,4.3\E{10}\Msun.
% the systematic uncertainty on the inclination angle may cause this estimate to differ by 
% a factor of $\sim$2.
Our estimate is likely a lower limit given the presence of a companion. In a merger model, 
the dynamical mass would be a factor of $\sim$2 higher \citep[and references therein]{Neri03a}.

 
\subsubsection{Linewidth and Sizes} 
FWHM from single gauss fit?
We find that the linewidths for both components (redshifted and blueshifted)
inferred from a double Gaussian fit to the line profile are
comparable to the C13 ULIRG sample
($\Delta v_{\rm FWHM}$ of 370\,\kms) and local ULIRGs
(300\pmm85\,\kms; \citealt[][]{Solomon97a}).
The CO gas in RXJ1131 is
distributed $\sim$6\pmm3\,kpc in radius across (in
the source plane), which is more extended than the
sample of disk-like U/LIRGs studied by
\citet[hereafter U14]{Ueda14a}, % also classified U/LIRG using FIR from 60, 100 micron measurements
who find an average radius of 3.5\,$\pm$\,2.3\,kpc
with a range spanning 1.1\,$-$\,9.3\,kpc.
% This is expected if the positive correlation in the linewidth-size relation
% holds at intermediate redshifts. Yet we cannot quantify this further
% with the data represented in this paper.
COMPARE WITH DOWNES SOLOMON98

\subsubsection{Gas Mass and Gas Ratios}
Using the lensing-corrected molecular gas mass of  
$M_{\rm gas}$\,=\,$($1.38\pmm0.33$)$\E{10}\,\Msun in RXJ1131 and
$($1.92\pmm0.09$)$\E{9}\,\Msun in its companion derived in \Sec{caveat}, 
a total molecular gas mass of $M_{\rm gas}^{\rm total}$\,=\,$($1.57\pmm0.38$)$\E{10}\,\Msun is 
residing within the merger system. 
This is comparable to the
C13 sample ($M_{\rm gas}$\,=\,1.5\E{10}\Msun) as well as
local U/LIRGs \citep{Solomon97a, Sanders96a} but higher than
in local LIRGs (U14).

% gas-to-dyn ratio
Using a dynamical mass of BLAH and the total gas mass ($M_{\rm gas}^{\rm total}$),
we find a gas-to-dynamical mass fraction of $f_{\rm gas-dyn}$\,=\,BLAH.
% gas to dust ratio:
Using the dust mass derived from SED fitting,
we find a gas-to-dust ratio of BLAH\pmm
BLAH, which is consistent with
the C13 sample ($f_{\rm gas-dust}$\,=\,206) and local U/LIRGs
(200$-$350; \citealt{Sanders91a}, Contini \& Contini 2003; Seaquist et al. 2004; Wilson et al. 2008).

\subsubsection{Conversion Factor $\alpha_{\rm CO}$}
Instead of adopting the conversion factor $\alpha_{\rm CO}$ as 0.8 (K \kms pc$^2$)\pmOne,
a crude estimate can be obtained using the dust mass and CO luminosity, assuming a 
gas-to-dust ratio.
Here we assume a gas-to-dust ratio of 72 (Sandstrom+13), based on a sample of local star-forming
galaxies of solar metallicities. 
We find $\alpha_{\rm CO}$ = BLAH\pmm$(f_{\rm gas-dust}/72)$ (K \kms pc$^2$)\pmOne, where the uncertainty does not include 
systematic uncertainties 
in the dust absorption coefficient $(\kappa)$ and the gas-to-dust ratio.
% which Kapa? Kappa 870 or Kappa we used in our dust mass esimate?
This ? 

\subsubsection{SFE and Depletion Timescales}
We derive the SFE using the far-IR luminosity definition used by
C13 (\ie SFE\pmm\LFIR$($40\,$-$\,500\,\micron)$/$$M_{\rm gas}$$)$,
we find a SFE of 31\pmm15 for RXJ1131, or equivalently a depletion
timescale of $\tau$\,=\,190\pmm70\,Myr. % 5.8/SFE Gyr
This SFE is substantially lower than most U/LIRGs
(\citealt{Solomon97a,Combes11a}; C13). % local ULIRG: 180 +/- 160 Lsun/M (Solomon+97)
% Combes+13: sample of 39 gal from z= 0.2-1 find $<$ 100 Myr.

Implication of this unexpectedly low SFE in RXJ1131...

At high redshifts, SMGs the irregular, turbulent starbursting galaxies (SFR $\sim$ BLAH \Msun yr\pmOne)
and BzK are the ``normal" star-forming disk galaxies with low SFE, relatively high SFR (BLAH) and 
longer depletion time (BLAH Myr).

\section{Discussion} \label{sec:diss}
\subsection{Merger stage of RXJ1131-1231}
Using the redshift inferred from the line center of the CO gas disk $(z_{\rm CO} = 0.6537)$ 
as the systemic redshift. The velocity offset from the optical lines $(z_{\rm AGN} = 0.658)$ 
is $\sim$780\,\kms. This may ? interaction

In this section, we put our results in context with other ULIRGs/mergers at
$z$\,=\,0\,$-$\,1. It is clear that RXJ1131 has a
gas-rich companion, but how does this affect its internal dynamics?
What is the merger stage of RXJ1131?
We argued that the symmetric source-plane velocity field suggest
the system is a minor merger, consistent with an earlier study by B08, who
independently conclude that the companion is likely
a dwarf of size $\sim$700\,kpc across.

While our result is consistent with other studies of RXJ1131, it
contrast strongly with studies of local (U)LIRGs/mergers
(\LIR\,=\,10$^{11-12.5}$\,\Lsun; $z$\,$<$\,0.1), where AGNs are
typically found in late stage mergers
\citep{Yuan10a,Iwasawa11a,Carpineti12a} and
that only these major mergers near their final
coalescence can provide \LIR\,$>$\,10$^{12}$\,\Lsun,
\citep[\eg][hereafter L16]{Carpineti15a,Larson16a}
\footnote{In this section, we adopt the total IR luminosity
calculated from 8\,$-$\,1000\,$\micron$
to be consistent with the classification used by these authors.}.
If this is also the case at $z$$\sim$0.65, it would imply RXJ1131
is a major merger near its final coalescence and that the spatially offset
component is likely an expulsion of gas driven by AGN winds or some
tidally ejected material from previous passage.
In that case, the molecular gas fraction in the host
galaxy should have declined (as seen in ellipticals) compared to early
stage mergers
\textbf{can we find molecular gas mass fraction as a
function of merger stage? also, what is the dynamical mass for RXJ1131}
and that the molecular gas would
be more concentrated in the nuclear region.
This is inconsistent with what
is observed for RXJ1131
(an extended gas-rich disk; but see also U14 for outliers
with extended molecular gas in merger remnants) and
the fact that there is on-going \SF activity.
Hence, we reject this and speculate the discrepancy is a consequence
of different power mechanisms of IR-luminous galaxies at intermediate redshift.

\subsubsection{Fate of RXJ1131-1231}
Has RXJ1131 encountered with the companion?

From numerical simulations, mergers are observable and distinguishable
with their kinematic and morphological features for 0.2$-$0.4 Gyr
between their second passage and final coalescence.

The spinning black hole in RXJ1131 provide one piece of
evidence that the two has already encountered.


% The future of RXJ1131:
Mergers are expected to evolve into
local ellipticals or large-disks (bulge dominated) (springel \& Hernquist 05, cite).
Given the
extended molecular gas distribution, we suggest RXJ1131 may evolve into the
latter (large-disk) unless the ``companion'' BKAH SOME STUFF or some other
mechanisms at play in the latter stage, transporting the gas
toward the central nuclear region and blah.

\subsection{Morphological Transformation}
While the space density of ULIRGs are only BLAH Mpc$^{-3}$ (CITE), 
the blah and the evolution in structure of high- and low-z galaxies
implying ULIRGs and mergers play an important role in giving rise to the BLAH.


\subsection{ULIRG Evolution and Cosmic SFH}
While there is an emerging consensus on the strong
evolution of the IR luminosity function \citep[\eg][]{Huynh07a,Seymour10a},
it is currently unclear whether the IR luminosity of
these intermediate redshift sources arise due to the merging of large spiral
galaxies, as typically seen in local ULIRGs, or proceed under a different
formation processes at higher redshifts. Our study blah...

% Implication on SFH
Our result indicates that...
% the gas mass fraction has already decreased
% at this redshift, which may suggest that the change in cosmic SFD is due to
% change in gas content. The SFE is also BLAH at this redshift,
% consistent with current speculation of how the SFRD decreases over cosmic time.

which seem probable given the relation in AGN growth and gas accumulation.
the simultaneous observation of the AGN phenomenon, of stellar formation and of galaxy interaction illustrates the current AGN ? black hole paradigm, according to which the growth of a black hole through the AGN phase occurs when galaxy interactions provide gas inflow towards the center (e.g. Hernquist 1989; Di Matteo et al. 2005). Since the interactions induce gravitational perturbations, simultaneous starbursts are also expected.

\section{Summary and Conclusions} \label{sec:sum}
% see Hodge12_dynamics.pdf for guide

%- summarize the findings from the entire study
%    - firm conclusions
%    - speculative possibilities

We investigate the cold gas kinematics and dynamics in
the lensed optical quasar RXJ1131 at $z_{\rm CO}$\,$\sim$0.65
by observing its \bco and \cco line emission.
Our results suggest that RXJ1131 is a wet-wet merger between an AGN/starburst
ULIRG and a optically faint companion.

% Fitting SED models, we find that the AGN host galaxy is a ULIRG.
% A faint companion as seen in HST observations (BJB) is also detected in our CO, confirming it's redshift and gas rich nature.

% % any further work needed to resolve the remaining problems
% We list several pieces of evidence through out
% this work to argue that RXJ1131 is likely a rotating disk.
% The double-horned profile, smooth, symmetric velocity field
% seen in our lens model and in the
% image plane and C06 model $n$=1 Sersic profile all suggest
% a kinematically-order (i.e., disk) galaxy.
% Yet, these are insufficient to conclude a disk morphology. Additional
% characteristics such as peak velocity dispersion at the central region and a
% ``spider'' diagram are needed, which is commonly seen in local spirals.
% The high dispersion near the dynamical center also
% suggest that RXJ1131 is turbulent, albeit lack of spatial resolution. Overall
% implies RXJ1131 is a minor merger of a turbulent disc, but higher-resolution
% data are needed to confirm this.

The compactness of the emission in $V$-band (rest-frame UV) 
suggests that the \SF in RXJ1131 is proceeding in a 
compact region embedded w/in a large reservoir of molecular gas, which may be explained 
by gas inflow toward nuclear regions due to interaction with the companion. 
Such a scenario may support the results in recent models: mergers/ULIRGs evolve into bulge dominated massive disks (Geach+09 sect 3.4).
