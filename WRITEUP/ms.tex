\section{Introduction}
We use a concordance $\Lambda$CDM cosmology throughout this paper, with parameters from the WMAP9 results:
$H_0$ = 70 \kms Mpc\pmOne, $\Omega_{\rm M}$ = 0.27, and $\Omega_{\Lambda}$ = 0.7 \citep{Hinshaw13a}.

\section{Observations}
\subsection{PdBI \bco} % DONE
Observations of the \bco rotational line ($\nu_{\rm rest}$ = 230.5379938 GHz)
toward the \gl galaxy RXJ1131-1231 at $z_{\rm QSO}$\,=\,0.658
were carried out using IRAM \pdbi (PdBI; Program ID: S14BX001; PI: D.
Riechers). Two observing runs were carried out on 2014 December 06 and 2015
February 05 under good weather conditions in the C and D array configurations,
respectively. The 2 mm receivers were used to cover the redshifted \bco line
and the underlying continuum emission, employing a correlator setup providing
an effective bandwidth of 3.6 GHz and a spectral resolution of 10.0 MHz ($\sim$
21.5 \kms). This resulted in 3.75 hours of cumulative six antenna-equivalent on-source
 time after discarding unusable visibility data.
The nearby quasars 1127$-$145 and 1124$-$186 were observed every 22 minutes
for pointing, secondary amplitude, and phase calibration and 1055$+$018 was
observed as bandpass calibrators for both tracks.
MWC349 and 3C279 were observed as the primary flux calibrator for C and D
array observations, respectively, yielding $\lesssim$15\% calibration accuracy.

The \ncode{GILDAS} package was used to reduce and analyze the visibility data
which are then imaged and deconvolved using the CLEAN algorithm with ``natural"
weighting. This yields a synthesized clean beam size of 4$\farcs$44 $\times$ 1\farcs95 (PA = 13\degr).
The final rms noise is $\sigma$ = 1.451 mJy \kms
beam\pmOne over 10 MHz (21.5 \kms). The continuum image at $\nu_{\rm cont}\sim$139\,GHz
is created by averaging over all the line-free channels. This
yields an rms noise of 0.082 mJy beam$^{-1}$. % see README.md in 04Sep15

\subsection{CARMA \cco} %DONE
Observations of the \cco rotational line ($\nu_{\rm rest}$ = 345.7959899 GHz)
were carried out under the D array configurations of the \carma (CARMA;
Program ID: cf0098; PI: D. Riechers) on 2014 February 02 under terrible 1.5\,mm
weather conditions and on 2014 February 17 under good 1.5\,mm
weather conditions. The correlator setup provides a bandwidth of 3.75 GHz in
each sideband and a spectral resolution of 12.5 MHz ($\sim$17.9 \kms). The
line was placed in the lower sideband with the local oscillator tuned to $\nu_{\rm LO}\sim$216 GHz. The radio quasars J1127$-$189 (first track) and 3C273
(second track) were observed
every 15 minutes for pointing, amplitude, and phase calibration. Mars was
observed as the primary absolute flux calibrator and 3C279 was observed as
bandpass calibrators for both tracks. This results in a total on-source time of 2.94 hours after flagging poor
visibility data.

Given that the phase calibrator used for the first track was faint and was
observed under poor weather conditions and that the phase calibrator used for
the second track was far from our target source, the phase calibration is
subpar, with an rms scatter $\sim$60\degr. We thus conservatively estimate
a calibration accuracy of $\sim$45\% based on the flux scale uncertainties,
the gain variations over time, and the phase scatter on the calibrated data. We
therefore treat its line intensity with caution and ensure that any physical interpretation
of this system (and thus implications and conclusions of this paper) do not rely on this quantity.

The \ncode{MIRIAD} package was used to calibrate the visibility data which are
then imaged and deconvolved using the CLEAN algorithm with ``natural" weighting. This yields a synthesized clean
beam size of 3\farcs2 $\times$ 1\farcs9 (PA = 8\degr) for the lower sideband
image cube. The final rms noise is $\sigma$ = 13.3 mJy km s$^{-1}$ beam$^{-1}$
over a channel width of 25 MHz. An rms noise of
$\sigma$ = 0.831 mJy beam\pmOne is reached by averaging over the
line-free channels.

\subsection{VLA} %DONE
Our analysis also use the archival data of the radio continuum obtained with the \vla (VLA; Program ID: AW741; PI: Wucknitz). Since these data have not been
published, we here describe the details of the observations as well as our calibration steps.

Observations were carried out on 2008 December 29 under excellent weather
conditions in the A array configurations for a total of $\sim$7 hours on-source time. The C$-$band receivers were used with a continuum mode setup,
providing a bandwidth of 50 MHz in each sideband.
The nearby radio quasar 1130$-$149 was observed every 10 minutes for
pointing, amplitude, and phase calibration, 1331$-$305 was observed as the
primary flux calibrator, and 0319$+$415 was observed as the bandpass
calibrator, yielding $\sim$10\% calibration accuracy.
We use \ncode{AIPS} to calibrate the visibility data which
are then imaged and deconvolved using
the CLEAN algorithm using robust\,=\,0. This yields a synthesized clean
beam size of 0$\farcs$49 $\times$ 0\farcs35 (PA\,=\,0\farcs18) and a final
rms noise of $\sigma$ = 13 $\mu$Jy beam\pmOne.


\section{HST astrometry} %DONE
We obtain {\it HST} images from the Hubble Legacy Archive with
a goal to understand the origins of the emission detected
in our mm observations. We adopt the VLA 5\,GHz map of $\sim$0\farcs5
resolution as the reference coordinate frame to align the optical ($V$-band) image.
We shift the latter to the east by 0\farcs5963 in R.A. and $+$0\farcs8372 in
Dec., which is consistent with the typical astrometric precision (1$-$2$^{\prime\prime}$) of
images from the Hubble Legacy Archive\footnote{http://hla.stsci.edu/hla\_faq.
html}. Such astrometric correction is critical to avoid artificial spatial
offsets between different emitting regions and to carry out our lens modeling,
in which the absolute position of the foreground lensing galaxy is guided by its
coordinates in the optical image, where its emission is clearly detected.
The VLA image is calibrated using a well-monitored phase
calibrator, with absolute positional accuracy of $\sim$2 mas.
For this reason, the absolute alignment between the VLA image and other
interferometric images reported in this paper are expected to have astrometric
precision better than 0\farcs1, modulo uncertainties related to the SNR, phase
errors, and beam size.

\section{Results}
\subsection{\bco Emission} \label{sec:CO21} %DONE
We dynamically resolved the \bco line emission toward the background galaxies
at $\gtrsim$27$\sigma$ significance, confirming the redshift at $z_{\rm CO}$ =
0.65370 $\pm$ 0.0005. A highly asymmetric double-horned line profile is
detected as shown in \Fig{CO21spec}. Fitting a double Gaussian results in peak
flux densities of 75.3$\pm$2.6 and 24.0$\pm$2.0 mJy, and a FWHM of
179$\pm$9 \kms and 255$\pm$28 \kms, respectively. The peaks are separated by
$\Delta v_{\rm sep}$ = 220 \kms. The integrated line flux is 24.1\,$\pm$\,2.3 Jy \kms. % see 15May16/

\Sec{differential} and the magnification factors for various kinematic
components are listed in \Tab{model}.

%   - note that theoretical sigma is lower = 1.5 * sqrt(160-126+1) * 21.5 ~ 0.2 Jy km/s /beam, due to higher noise in some channels with emission
We construct the zeroth, first and second moment maps shown in \Fig{CO21mom}
using the $uv$-continuum subtracted data cube, over $\Delta v$$\sim$750 \kms.
The first and second moment maps are clipped at 3$\sigma$.
The peak flux density is 8.12 $\pm$ 0.30 Jy\,\kms\,beam\pmOne in the intensity-integrated
map. The deconvolved source size is estimated to be 5\farcs1$\pm$0\farcs72 $\times$ 3\farcs72$\pm$0\farcs66
and thus the emission is resolved over $\sim$2.2 beams.
While the lensed emission is not strictly distributed as 2D-Gaussian,
the fit recovers the line intensity enclosed within the emitting
region, we therefore take this as an estimate on the extent of the lensed
emission. On the other hand, if we assume the spatial distribution of
the lensed molecular gas emission is similar to that in the optical to \nir
wavelengths, the lensed emission would be more accurately described by an
annulus, enclosing the partially complete ``Einstein Ring" and
the lensed knots (see \Fig{CO21mom}).

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

\caption{Left: an overlay of the velocity-integrated \bco emission on the {\it HST} $V$--band (F555W)
image. Right: contours are color-coded to represent the red and blue wings of the emission.
The contours start at 3$\sigma$ and increment at steps of
$\pm$3$\sigma$, where $\sigma$\,=\,0.3 mJy beam\pmOne. The crosses denote the
location of the foreground galaxy at $z$\,=\,0.295.
\label{fig:CO21mom}}
\end{figure}

The emission of the red component coincides with the Einstein Ring seen in the
optical image, with most of its apparent flux originating from the lensed arc
in the Southeast, whereas the blue component is predominately coming from
solely the lensed arc shown in \Fig{CO21mom}. To illustrate this, we show the
channel maps of 21.5\,\kms width and spatial spectra of 1\farcs5 resolution in
\Fig{chanmap} and \Fig{spatialSpec}, respectively. The figures show that emission
is present to the West and peaks toward the lensing arc (black across in \Fig{chanmap})
in the red wing, and shifts to the East with decreasing velocity (blue wing).
This indicates extended emission in the source plane, where
emission from different kinematic components is separated by different amounts
relative to the caustics. One consequence of such is the observed asymmetric
line profile. A detailed analysis on differential lensing of \bco is presented in \Sec{differential}.

$\sigma$ = 1.451mJy per channel beam\pmOne.
Assuming a typical line width of 300 \kms, this corresponds to a 3$\sigma$
limit of 4.353 mJy \kms beam\pmOne.

\subsection{Origin of the \bco Emission} \label{sec:origin} %DONE
Evidently, the CO emission is co-spatial with the lensed optical emission in
the background AGN host galaxy.
The question is then whether the optically
faint companion also contributes to the CO flux and thus contains a
non-negligible amount of molecular gas.
Indeed, based on our lens model presented in \Sec{lensmodel}, we find it
highly likely that part of the CO emission originates from
the companion. We thus classify RXJ1131 as a ``wet-wet'' merger.
However, we cannot quantify this with a mass ratio given the
spatial resolution, nor can we rule out the possibility that
the ``companion'' is instead a gas component/tidal feature ripped out
from previous interaction. In the subsequent sections, we will interpret
the this additional source component as gas emission
in a nearby galaxy (i.e. a ``wet-wet'' merger), as suggested by previous studies of RXJ1131.

\subsection{\bco Kinematics} % DONE
A clear velocity gradient and an unusually high
velocity dispersion ($\gtrsim$400\kms) near the central region
is seen in \Fig{CO21highO}. While beam smearing is inevitably the
dominant factor in the observed velocity dispersion
at the spatial resolution of this data, the exceedingly
high velocity dispersion hints
at potential perturbations from the AGN, or internal turbulence due to
interactions with the companion, and/or instability due to the large gas
content. A velocity gradient across the source plane in \Fig{model} is also
found in our lens model. This further supports the idea of a
kinematically-ordered galaxy, but its emission has been lensed differentially.
In this scenario, RXJ1131 is a disrupted disk galaxy hosting an optically
bright quasar and is in the process of merging.
We will defer the discussion of its implications to \Sec{dynamics},
where we analyze the dynamics of the system in the source plane.

\caption{

50 \kms, and 100 \kms, respectively. The beam (native resolution) is shown in the right panel.
\label{fig:CO21highO}}
\end{figure}


\subsection{\cco Emission} % DONE
We detect resolved \cco line emission toward RXJ1131. The spectrum is shown in
\Fig{co32spec}, which seems to have a double-peak profile.
This is expected if RXJ1131 is truly a disk galaxy (see previous
sections). The high phase noise in the calibration leads to a low SNR
detection. We thus estimate the line intensity to be
35.7$\pm$ 21.9 Jy\,\kms by summing up fluxes over the
linewidth used to infer \bco line intensity ($\sim$700 \kms).

\begin{figure}[!Htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.455\textwidth]{../Figures/coOverlay.eps}
\caption{CARMA \cco line profile (solid) without continuum subtraction is
over-plotted on the continuum-subtracted \bco line profile (dashed).
The velocity scale is with respect to $z$=0.6537, which corresponds to the
dynamical center of the \bco line. The spectral resolution for \cco and \bco
is 35.8 \kms and 21.5 \kms, respectively.
 \label{fig:co32spec}}
\end{figure}

Assuming the spatial extents between \bco and \cco are similar and therefore
a negligible differential lensing effect, the line intensities
correspond to a brightness temperature ratio of
$r_{\rm 32}$\,=\,T$_{\tiny \cco}$/T$_{\tiny \bco}$\,=\,0.66\,$\pm$\,0.41.
The high uncertainty is dominated by the uncertainties in the \cco line
intensity.

\subsection{Interferometric Continuum} %DONE
No 1.5\,mm continuum emission is detected at the position of \cco
down to a 3$\sigma$ limit of 2.49mJy beam\pmOne.
This is consistent with the spectrum shown in \Fig{co32spec}.

We detect PdBI 2\,mm continuum in \Fig{cont}. The integrated flux density is
1.2$\pm$0.2 mJy, with a peak flux $S_\nu$ = 800$\pm$88 \micron Jy\,beam\pmOne
centering on the lensing galaxy. A slightly extended emission is also seen
along the lensed arc. This suggests that the detected emission comes from
both the foreground galaxy and the background galaxy and that the
emission is marginally resolved along its major axis.
We subtract a point source model in $uv$-plane to remove the unresolved
emission toward the foreground galaxy. The peak flux (0.389$\pm$0.082 mJy)
in the residual map coincides with the lensed arc, and is consistent with
the difference between the integrated and the peak flux in the
original continuum map ($\sim$0.4 mJy). We therefore adopt
$S_\nu$ = 0.39$\pm$0.08 mJy as the 2\,mm continuum emission toward
the background galaxy.

$\sigma_{\rm 5GHz}$\,=\,13 $\mu$Jy beam\pmOne in the left and right panel, respectively.
The central crosses indicate the centroid of the foreground galaxy,
as detected in the optical image. The synthesis beams are shown in the bottom left corner of each panel.
\label{fig:cont}}\vspace{0.51em}
\end{figure}

The VLA C-band continuum image in \Fig{cont} shows resolved emission from the
jets and core of the foreground elliptical galaxy
as well as emission toward the background quasar.
Multiple peaks are seen along the arc and their centroids
coincide with the optical emission from the quasar.
We extract the flux densities for the arc and the core in \Tab{photometry}.
We find a spectral index of $\alpha$\,=\,$-$0.024 for the foreground
galaxy and $\alpha$\,=\,$-$0.345 for the background galaxy by fitting a
power-law (S$_\nu \propto \nu^{\alpha}$) to the continuum emission at
5\,GHz and 2\,mm.

\subsection{Photometry} \label{sec:photometry} %DONE
We compile \mir to \fir broadband photometry (uncorrected for
dust extinction) from various
catalogs available on the NASA/IPAC Infrared Science
Archive (IRSA) in \Tab{photometry} with aperture corrections
when warranted. These data were obtained from
the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS; \citealt{Skrutskie06a}),
Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer ({\it WISE}; \citealt{Wright10a}),
{\it Infrared Astronomical Satellite}
({\it IRAS};\citealt{Neugebauer84a}), and
the Multiband Imaging Photometer (MIPS; \citealt{Rieke04a}) and
Mid-infrared Infrared Array Camera (IRAC; \citealt{Fazio04a}) on
\spitzer.
We retrieve PBCD (level 2) {\it Spitzer}/IRAC images from the
Spitzer Heritage Archive and perform aperture photometry on
the channel 1 image to extract flux density at 3.6\,$\mu$m
since it is not available from the IRSA archive.

The emission in the IRAC images is slightly extended. We thus use the
{\it HST} image ($\sim$0\farcs07 resolution) to determine
origins of their centroids, all of which are found to be
centered at the position corresponding to the lensed emission from the
background galaxy. To recover the diffuse background emission, we subtract a
point source model centered on the lensing galaxy, using the average
FWHM found by fitting a Gaussian profile to several field stars
with the \ncode{imexam} routine of IRAF.
We perform aperture photometry on the residual image
to obtain decomposed flux measurements from the background galaxy.
The photometries for the foreground galaxy are then obtained
by subtracting the fluxes decomposed for the background source
from the observed total flux. The resulting photometry in
\Tab{photometry} are obtained after performing aperture correction
described in the IRAC Instrument Handbook\footnote{http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/SPITZER/docs/irac/iracinstrumenthandbook/} to
correct for the fact that the IRAC imaging was calibrated
using a 12" aperture, which is bigger than the aperture (5\farcs8) we used to
perform aperture photometry. This step was taken to provide
constraints on the Wien tail beyond the dust peak of the
spectral energy distribution (SED) of RXJ1131.
Details of the SED modeling is presented in \Sec{SED}.

Extraction of the {\it Herschel}/SPIRE photometry was
carried out using SUSSEXTractor within Herschel Interactive
Processing Environment (HIPE; \citealt{Ott10a})
over the Level 2 maps obtained from the Herschel Science Archive.
These maps were processed by the SPIRE pipeline
version 13.0 within HIPE. The SUSSEXtractor task estimates
the flux density from an image convolved with a kernel
derived from the SPIRE beam. The flux density
measured by SUSSEXtractor is additionally confirmed
using the Timeline Fitter, which performs photometry
by fitting a 2D elliptical Gaussian to the Level 1 data at the
source position given by the output of SUSSEXtractor.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Analysis}
\subsection{Lens modeling} \label{sec:lensmodel} %DONE
At the angular resolution of the \bco data, the images are resolved
but not within the multiply lensed emission (i.e., sub-optimal for
performing lens modeling). Nevertheless, the high spectral
resolution of this data provides dynamical information on
spatial scales smaller than the beam (see \Fig{CO21highO}).
Hence, with the high SNR, we reconstruct the intrinsic gas
dynamics by carrying out a parametric lens modeling over different
channel slices of the interferometric data using our lensing code
\uvmcmcfit (\citealt{uvmcmcfit15a}; see \citealt{Bussmann15a} for details of
the code). Model of each slice in \Fig{model} thus provides
properties on the intrinsic kinematics. The slices
are obtained by binning the data (over the full linewidth
$\sim$700\kms; see \Sec{CO21}) by five channels (i.e., into seven slices)
 to increase the SNR.

The lens mass distribution is modeled using a singular isothermal
ellipsoid (SIE) profile, which is described by five free parameters: the
positional offset in R.A. and Dec. relative to an arbitrary chosen
fixed coordinate in the image, the Einstein Radius, the axial ratio, and the
position angle. We use the VLA radio continuum emission toward
the foreground galaxy to initialize the positional offset. We impose a
uniform prior $\pm$0\farcs05 in both $\Delta$R.A. and $\Delta$Dec.,
motivated by the astrometry uncertainties in the VLA image as well as
the uncertainties provided by previous SIE lens model (C06).
We initialize the Einstein Radius based on the model parameters reported by C06
and impose a uniform prior using $\pm$3$\sigma$ of their uncertainties.
The sources are modeled using elliptical Gaussian profiles, which are
parameterized by six free parameters: the positional offset in R.A.
and Dec. relative to the lens, the intrinsic flux density, the effective
radius, the axial ratio, and the position angle. The position of each source
is allowed to vary between $\pm$1\farcs5 (i.e., within the Einstein Radius)
and the effective radius is allowed to vary from 0\farcs01$-$2".

% Check with Shane
{\bf NEEDS EDIT}
Our code uses an Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to sample the
posterior probability distribution function (PDF).
In each model, we require a target acceptance rate of $\sim$0.25$-$0.5
and check for chain convergence by inspecting the trace plots
AND BLAH to verify we are sampling beyond an autocorrelation time.
We employ $\sim$50,000 samples as the initial ``burn-in'' stage
to stabilize the Markov chains (which we then discard) and
use the final $\sim$5,000 steps, sampled by 128 walkers, to identify
the posterior. Here, we
identify the best-fit model and the quoted uncertainties using the
median and the 68\% confidence intervals in the marginal PDFs.
\input{table_medianLens}

We first obtain a preliminary lens model for each channel slice independently,
where their lens parameters are allowed to vary and are initialized according
to the aforementioned way. We obtain the final model
by repeating the modeling over each slice but fixing their lens parameters
according to the overall median in the preliminary models,
as listed in \Tab{lens}.
This ensures that all models share the same lens profile.
The magnification factors in \Tab{model} are determined by taking the ratio
between the image plane flux and the source plane flux of each model.

Our model parameters in \Tab{lens}, describing
the mass distribution of the lensing galaxy, are consistent (within the uncertainties)
with that of the SIE model presented by C06. We find a mass of
$M(\theta$\,\,$<$\,\,$\theta_\textrm{E})$\,=\,(7.47\,$\pm$\,0.02)\,$\times$\,10$^{11}$\,\Msun
within the Einstein radius.

\subsubsection{Interpretation and Caveats} \label{sec:caveat} %DONE
The reconstructed source locations in \Fig{model} demonstrate
an intrinsic velocity gradient across the source plane, which is
indicative of a disk geometry. While solely based on the
lens model is insufficient to draw conclusive inference on its
true geometry. Additional support to the disk conjecture %conjecture of a disk morphology
can be found in the double-horned line profile (\Fig{CO21spec})
and the observed (image plane) velocity field (\Fig{CO21highO}). Furthermore,
C06 also find that the reconstructed source plane emission in optical-NIR
is best-reproduced using a $n$\,=\,1 Sersic profile.
Our interpretation therefore tends in favor of a disk morphology for RXJ1131.

% the companion
One other interesting result from our lens model is that a better fit is
found for the red-most channel if we add a second source component (see
top left panel in \Fig{model}). This is consistent with previous results
reported by \citet{Brewer08a}, who find an optically faint companion
(component F in their paper) $\sim$2.4\,kpc away from the AGN host galaxy,
and C06, who find evidence for an interacting dusty galaxy.
Spatially, the red velocity component of the CO also coincides with this
component F. While we cannot quantify the type of
merger (major v.s. minor) with a mass ratio given the
spatial resolution, the symmetric velocity gradient may lean support
towards a minor merger.

We emphasize that the spatial resolution of the data at hand
is a few arcsec, which implies that despite the high SNR and spectral
resolution, this data is insufficient to constrain the
intrinsic sizes of the lensed galaxies, and thus the magnification
factors ares likely under-predicted.
We will discuss this further in the following section. % magnification factor is underpredicted, see Bussmann15

\subsubsection{Differential Lensing} \label{sec:differential} %DONE
\input{table_magFactor}
Previous lens models of RXJ1131 find conspicuous
differential lensing effect across {\it HST}
$H$-, $V$-, and $I$-band (C06), where the
magnification factor ranges from 10.9 to 7.8. C06 attribute
the decrease toward the IR regime is caused by the more extended
IR emission, arising from \SF.
The highly asymmetric \bco line profile suggests that
differential lensing is also non-negligible for CO, where the redshifted
emission is apparently much brighter than that in the
blueshifted emission, consistent
with the source positions relative to the caustics in \Fig{model}.
The red wing emission mainly originates near the cusp
in the caustic, whereas the blue wing emission is located beyond the caustics.
The magnification factor for CO ranges from 8.7 to 3.1 (\Tab{model}).

\subsection{\bco Dynamical modeling} \label{sec:dynamics} %DONE
This section proceeds under the assumption that RXJ1131 is
a rotating disk (see previous sections).
Assuming the velocities of the respective channels used in
lens modeling correspond to solely the tangential component of the
true velocity vector (i.e., along the major axis), we extract
a one dimensional PV diagram in \Fig{PV}
by slicing across their source plane positions (PA: 121\degr).

We attempt to characterize the molecular gas kinematics using an empirically motivated disk model \citep[\eg][]{Courteau97a,Puech08a,Miller11a}:
\begin{equation}
V = V_0 + \frac{2}{\pi} V_{a} \arctan(\frac{R}{R_{t}}),
\end{equation}
where $V$ is the observed velocity, $V_0$ is the velocity at dynamical center,
$V_{a}$ is the asymptotic velocity, and $R_{t}$ is the ``turnover''
radius at which the rotation curve becomes flat.
We perform non-linear least square fitting using an orthogonal distance
regression to find the best-fit parameters,
taking into account the uncertainties in both velocity (channel width) and
distance offset. We also place an upper limit on $R_{t}$\,$<$15 kpc
to keep this parameter physical \citep[\eg][]{Puech08a,Miller11a}.
The parameter uncertainties are inferred based on Monte Carlo simulation
of 500 iterations, where the input parameters are perturbed
according to random Gaussian distributions of sigmas
corresponding to their uncertainties.
Using this model, we find $V_{a}$\,=\,975\,$\pm$\,387 \kms,
$R_{t}$\,=\,10.6\,$\pm$\,5.7\,kpc, and $V_0$\,=\,28\,$\pm$\,40 \kms.
We note, however, that since emission is not detected beyond the flat regime
of the rotation curve, the asymptotic velocity is poorly constrained and
the ``turnover'' radius is at most a lower limit.
In particular, $V_{a}$ and $R_{t}$ are highly correlated with a
Pearson coefficient $R$\,=\,0.998, and 0.027 between $V_{a}$ and $V_0$.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

\caption{PV slice along the major axis in the source plane at PA\,=\,121\degr.

each model and the horizontal error bars are the
1$\sigma$ uncertainties on the source plane positions.
DR may suggest include MC simulation fits, maybe I will do that later.
 \label{fig:PV}}
\end{figure}

We note that the asymptotic velocity ($V_{a}$) -- an extrapolation of the model
out to radius beyond the disk scale-length and half-light radius --
is inequivalent to maximum observed velocity ($V_{\rm max}$),
which is commonly used in literature to parameterize disc rotation.
The arctangent model is most commonly used in studies of the
Tully-Fisher relation, where an extrapolation to V$_{2.2}$ (velocity
at 2.2 disc scale-length or $\sim$1.375 half-light radius,
or $\sim$0.7$R_{\rm opt}$\footnote{Radius enclosing 83\% of the light
distribution.}) is typically adopted
as the rotation velocity ($V_{\rm max}$ in their
terminology) since this corresponds to the radius at which the velocity
of a pure exponential disc peaks.
We here adopt the maximum {\em observed} velocity
$V_{\rm rot}$\,=\,345\,$\pm$\,55\,\kms at 6\,$\pm$\,3\,kpc from the
dynamical center as a proxy to the rotation velocity.
This radius corresponds to $\sim$0.6$R_e$, where $R_e$ is the half-light
radius $\sim$10.3\,kpc inferred from the C06 lens model (converted to
our cosmology) over the {\it HST} $I$-band image.
We note that the source plane half-light radius varies substantially with
wavelength: $R_e$ $\sim$\,4kpc and $\sim$7\,kpc based on models over
$V$-band \citep{Brewer08a} and $H$-band (C06), respectively.
This discrepancy arises owing to the exclusion of the more
diffused emission in $V$-band (rest-frame UV),
which traces recent massive \SF.
% On the other hand, $I$-band traces the more evolved stellar population.
This indicates that the molecular gas may be ....
DR: ok, let's discuss this.

Using this $V_{\rm rot}$, we find a dynamical mass of
$M_{\rm dyn}$\,sin$^2 i$\,($<$\,6\,kpc$)$ = 17\E{10}\,\Msun enclosed
within the CO-emitting region. If we instead consider the
line peak separation from the
\bco line profile $\Delta v_{\rm sep}/2 \sim$110\,\kms, we find
$M_{\rm dyn}$\,sin$^2 i$\,($<$\,6\,kpc$)$ = 1.8\E{10}\,\Msun.
DR: here, I list the extrema for possible Mdyn given our data,
should I say anything more?
We correct for the inclination effect using the
morphological axial ratio from the reconstructed image (Figure 3 in C06), where
the minor axis is 1\farcs8 and the major axis is 3\farcs25.
We thus find an inclination angle of 56.4\degr, which is consistent with the
observed unobscured AGN and an observable double peak line profile.
The dynamical mass is then
2.5\E{10}\Msun\,$<$\,$M_{\rm dyn}$($<$6\,kpc)\,$<$\,25\E{10}\Msun.
Since this quantity is derived under the assumption that the gas is
virialized, which is highly unlikely given the velocity dispersion and the
presence of a close companion, our estimate is
at most a lower limit. We caution that this analysis is
based on limited spatial
resolution data and will be verified by future higher-resolution
observations.

\subsection{SED modeling} \label{sec:SED}
By fitting a power-law spectrum $S_\nu \propto \nu^\alpha$ to the decomposed
IRAC photometry. We find a spectral index of $\alpha\sim-$1.9 and
$\alpha\sim-$0.85 for the lensing galaxy and RXJ1131, respectively.
This is consistent with the mean spectral slope of optical quasars
(optically-selected) ($\alpha\sim-$1, Elvis et al. 1994;
Neugebauer et al. 1979).
For comparison, broad-line AGN from the AGN and Galaxy
Evolution Survey (AGES, C. S. Kochanek et al., in prep) have 3.6$-$8 \micron slopes of $\alpha$ = $-$1.07$\pm$0.53 (Stern et al. 2005).



We extrapolated a power-law to 24 \micron to decompose the flux
at 24 \micron in MIPS.
Since the contribution from AGN is not taken into account in SBURT, it is expected that the SEDs of AGN candidates show an excess in the MIR, owing to hot dust around the central massive black hole,
NIR not corrected for extinction.


We fit SED models to the photometry of dust emission in RXJ1131-1231 with a power-law attached to the blue side.
We include the IRAS 60\micron and 100\micron upper limits to constrain the dust peak.
We also fit SED models including the decomposed 24.0\micron data (see \Sec{photometry})

Spitzer mid-IR spectroscopy of local ULIRGs will indicate the appropriate luminosity fraction that needs to be assigned to the AGN for ULIRGs before and after nuclear coalescence.

We find a power-law slope of BLAH,
Previous studies find that in the absence of mid-IR data, a powerlaw slope of $\alpha$ = 2 is consistent with SB and slightly more shallow, $\sim$1.5, for SB/AGN composite systems (Blain et al., 2003; Casey, 2012; Koss et al., 2013).

For these parameter estimation problems using MCMC to sample,
the full answer is the full joint posterior PDF.
We here report the summary statistics (global mode (where min. chi),
marginal mode (in log file),
posterior median (instead of posterior means; need to compute) and the 1$\sigma$ confidence intervals in the marginal PDF) to reflect the PDF shape.






\subsection{Physical properties}
In this section, we derive the gas properties of RXJ1131 based on \bco,
and compare the derived quantities against those reported by
\citet[; hereafter C13]{Combes13a}, which is the largest sample of
ULIRGs at intermediate redshift (0.6\,$<$\,$z$\,1.0) with CO measurements,
to place RXJ1131 in context of existing studies. Their results are
based on \bco and \rot{4}{3} line observations on the IRAM 30-m dish.

%line width & extent
We find that the linewidths for both components (redshifted and blueshifted)
inferred from a double Gaussian fit to the \bco line profile are
consistent with the C13 sample (FWHM of 370\,\kms). Such linewidths are higher
than in local ULIRGs (240\,\kms; \citet[][]{Solomon97a}).
Since C13 do not have resolved observations, we compare the
gas distribution (size) with local ULIRGs. The CO gas in RXJ1131 is
distributed $\sim$6\,kpc in radius across (in
the source plane), which is more extended than the
sample of disk-like ULIRGs studied by \citet{Ueda14a},
who find an average radius of 3.5\,$\pm$\,2.3\,kpc,
(with a range from 1.1 kpc to 9.3 kpc).
This indicates that the positive correlation in the linewidth-size relation
holds in ULIRGs at intermediate redshifts. Yet we cannot quantify this further
with the data represented in this paper.
{\bf implication on this in discussion}
% gas mass
To derive the molecular gas mass, we first correct for lensing magnification
using the respective magnification factors listed in \Tab{model}, which to
first order takes into account effect of differential lensing. This yields
$I$\,=\,5.9$\pm$2.7 Jy\,\kms, where the uncertainty includes those on
the magnification factors. This includes the CO emission from the companion
as the resolution of our data do not allow us decompose its contribution
to the total line flux. Without direct \rot{1}{0} measurements,
we derive \rot{1}{0} intensity
using a brightness temperature ratio of $r_{\rm 32}$\,=\,1, which was chosen
solely to facilitate a comparison with the C13 sample. For the same reason, we
adopt a luminosity-to-mass conversion factor of
\alphaco\,=0.8 (K \kms pc$^2$)\pmOne. This yields
\Lp\,=\,(3.47\,$\pm$\,1.58)\E{10}\,\Lsun and a gas mass
of (2.8$\pm$1.3)\,\E{10} \Msun in RXJ1131. This is likely
an overestimation due to a contribution from the companion, but is
nevertheless consistent with C13 ($M_{\rm gas}$\,=\,1.5\E{10}\Msun) within the
uncertainties. Using the dynamical mass of BLAH (see \Sec{dynamics}), we find
a gas-to-dynamical mass fraction of $f_{\rm gas-dyn}$\,=\,BLAH.
% gas to dust ratio:
Based on the dust mass derived from SED fitting, we find a gas-to-dust ratio of
$f_{\rm gas-dust}$\,=\,BLAH, consistent with Combes+13: 206 ?
 Typical local (U)LIRGs are found to have a
gas-to-dust mass ratio of 200–350 (Sanders et al. 1991; Contini
& Contini 2003; Seaquist et al. 2004; Wilson et al. 2008).

We correct for lensing magnification using the median among our models ($\mu_{\rm L}$=BLAH).
Assuming a Salpeter initial mass function, we find the SFR of blah using the \fir luminosity after corrected for lensing .

\subsubsection{Gas properties}

Since RXJ1131 has a companion, i.e. not dynamically relaxed, the dynamical mass estimate using a virial estimator is likely underestimated.

\subsection{Mass in RXJ1131}
black hole mass
dynamical mass
stellar mass
dust mass

Assuming local $M_{\rm BH}-M_{\rm bulge}$ relation, this would imply $M_{\rm bulge}$$\sim$BLAH\Msun.

% gas-dyn fraction:
% can we quantify the merger stage of RXJ1131? what are typical gas fraction at different merger stage. What are the alpha CO used in those (0.8, see Uedaa14)
% since ellipticals are not expected to have high gas fraction. The fact that there are on-going, recent, massive episodes of SF activity, the velocity gradient, and the best-fit sersic profile from C06 all support the picture that RXJ is a disk galaxy.

\subsection{Merger stage of RXJ1131-1231}
We put our results in content with ULIRGs/mergers in $z$=0$-$1.

As discussion in previous sections, while we see evidence such as a symmetric velocity field in the source plane, double-horned profile, observed velocity
gradient, C06 model $n$=1 Sersic profile, which suggest that RXJ1131 is likely a rotating disc. Yet, this is insufficient to conclude a disk morphology. Additional characteristics such as peak velocity dispersion at the central region and a ``spider'' diagram are needed, which is commonly seen in local spirals.
\\

Kinematics and mergers:
For major mergers, two galaxy mass centers separated on the same scale as the gas disk (4 kpc or more), the gas dynamics would be strongly perturbed and would deviate substantially from that of a simple disk.

In a minor merger (a mass ratio of more than 3:1) the more massive galaxy, including its gas distribution, can retain a significant angular momentum and resemble a rotating disk.

RXJ kinematics:
The smooth, symmetric velocity field seen in our lens model and image plane
suggest a kinematically-order (i.e., disk) galaxy. However, the high
dispersion near the dynamical center suggest that RXJ1131 is turbulent, albeit
lack of spatial resolution. Overall implies RXJ1131 is a minor merger of a turbulent disc, but higher-resolution data are needed to confirm this.
Although these values are discussed in \Sec{blah} we cannot draw any general conclusions concerning BLAH.


Mergers are observable for 0.2-0.4 Gyr,
between 2nd passage and coalescence.
Kinematic asymmetries follow morphological asymmetries during
mergers. Mergers are kinematically detectable for 0.2-0.4 Gyr
between second passage and coalescence.


Numerical simulations of mergers between two galaxies have shown that multiple, discrete starburst events can be triggered even in double mergers. The timing of the starbursts is thought to depend on the progenitor galaxy morphologies, with early starbursts (before the galaxies start to merge) occurring in bulges disc galaxies, and late starbursts (after the galaxies have started to merge) occur- ring in disc galaxies with a bulge component (Mihos \& Hernquist 1994, 1996.
Maybe the more compact rest-frame SF and the more recent NIR SF, which is also more extended and diffuse is consistent with the spinning black hole, i.e.
already encountered?

At low redshifts the ULIRG luminosity function shows strong evolution with redshift (Veilleux et al. 1999).

We observed the cold molecular gas properties using \bco and \cco line emission
toward the AGN host galaxy RXJ1131 at $z_{\rm CO}$\,$\sim$0.65.
Our results suggest that RXJ1131 is a wet-wet merger between a AGN/starburst
ULIRG and a optically faint companion.


Fitting SED models, we find that the AGN host galaxy is a ULIRG.
A faint companion as seen in HST observations (BJB) is also detected in our CO, confirming it's redshift and gas rich nature.
