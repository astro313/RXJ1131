For arxiv:
changed all eps --> .pdf
 - can just rename fx-eps-converted-to.pdf
updated ms.tex to include .pdf after filename
- maybe also need to change \acknowledgements to \begin{} \end{}

- also need to upload .sty files
- also need to upload RXJ.bib file & !! the ms.bbl file because arxiv doesn't do bibtex!! 
- copy the one from ../, becuase of the manual (C13) aliases
